# RudderStack Event Streams

## What are Sources in RudderStack?

Sources are the tools or platforms from which the event data can be ingested into RudderStack. This event data can then be routed \(with or without transformation\) into your data warehouse or preferred destinations for analytics or other activation use-cases.

## RudderStack Event Streams

RudderStack's Event Streams allow you to collect your event data from all of your sites and applications and route it to a wide array of customer tools and data warehouses via RudderStack.
