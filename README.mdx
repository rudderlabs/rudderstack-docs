# RudderStack Docs

This repository contains the documentation markdown (`.mdx`) source files and the Gatsby code for [**rudderstack.com/docs**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/).

At this time, building docs locally requires an internal CMS key, so contributions should be limited to editing `mdx` files. We will fully open-source the local build in a future update.
