# FAQ

### How do I use the Warehouse Actions feature?

RudderStack's Warehouse Actions feature lets you set up your data warehouse as a source in RudderStack and route the data residing in it to your preferred destination.

To use this feature, follow these steps:

1. Set up a Warehouse Actions source in RudderStack.
2. Connect it to a new or existing destination.
3. Specify the warehouse data you want to sync to that destination.

### Can I connect a Warehouse Actions source to multiple destinations?

This feature does not support connecting one source to multiple destinations currently.

Therefore, if you want to send data from a Warehouse Actions source to multiple destinations, it is recommended to create multiple copies of the warehouse source with the same settings and connect them with each of the destinations.

### Can I connect a Warehouse Actions source to a warehouse destination in RudderStack?

No, RudderStack currently does not support this functionality.

### What event types are currently supported by this feature?

Currently, the Warehouse Actions sources support only `identify()` events.

### What is the difference between the Table and Model options when creating a Warehouse Actions source?

When creating a new Warehouse Actions source, you are presented with the following two options from which RudderStack will sync the data:

- When you choose **Table**, RudderStack imports all the data associated with the specified warehouse table during the sync.
- When you choose **Model**, RudderStack imports the data by running the query specified in the connected model during the sync.

### What is the difference between Basic, CRON, and Manual schedule settings?

When creating a new Warehouse Actions source, RudderStack lets you schedule your data imports and define how and when the data syncs will run.

RudderStack defines the following three sync schedule types:

| Schedule type | Description |
| :--------------| :------------|
| Basic | Runs syncs at a user-specified time and interval. | 
| CRON | Runs syncs based on a user-defined CRON expression. |
| Manual | User triggers the data syncs manually. |

### What is the difference between Upsert and Mirror mode when syncing data?

RudderStack supports two modes (available based on the source and the chosen destination) that let you define how you want to sync your data. These are **Upsert** and **Mirror** mode.

- In the **Upsert** mode, RudderStack supports insertion of new records and updates to the existing records, while syncing data to the destination.
- In the **Mirror** mode, RudderStack 'mirrors' the source by keeping the destination data the same as the source data. It performs insertion, updates, and deletion of records while syncing data to the destination.

### I'm unable to run a sync manually and get the message "Your pipeline is paused. Make sure that the source and at least one destination is enabled". What do I do?

This message appears when either your Warehouse Actions source, the connected destination, or both are disabled. Go to the **Settings** tab to verify if the source and destination are enabled for data syncs.
