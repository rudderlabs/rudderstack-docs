# ClickHouse

[ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.tech/) is an open-source, column-oriented database management system mainly used for online analytical processing \(OLAP\). It lets you generate analytical reports that are updated in real-time using SQL queries. ClickHouse is highly scalable, fast, and built for high performance.

RudderStack supports ClickHouse as a source from which you can ingest data and route it to your desired downstream destinations.

## Setting up ClickHouse as source in RudderStack

To set up ClickHouse as a source in RudderStack, follow these steps:

### Naming the source

1. Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderlabs.com/signup?type=freetrial).

2. From the left navigation bar, go to **Source** > **New Source** > **Warehouse Actions**.  Then, select **ClickHouse**, as shown:

3. Assign a name to your source.

### Configuring the connection credentials

1. Enter the relevant settings in the **Connection Credentials** section as listed below:

- **Host** - Host name of your ClickHouse service.
- **Port** - Port number of your ClickHouse service.
- **Database -** Database name in your ClickHouse instance where the data is loaded.
- **User** - Username which has the required read/write access to the above database.
- **Password** - Password for the above user.
- **Secure** - Enabling this setting establishes a secure connection and displays additional settings as mentioned below:

  - **Skip Verify** - Skips certificate verification. Set this field to `true` if you are using self-signed certificates.
  - **CA certificate** -  Certificate contents of the certificate which needs to be verified while establishing a secure connection.

If you've configured ClickHouse as a source before, you can select the existing credentials from <strong>Use existing credentials</strong> option.
</div>

2. Click on **Continue** to verify your credentials. RudderStack will then verify and validate your credentials. 

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on these validation steps, refer to the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section. 
</div>

3. Once verified, click on **Continue** to proceed.

### Schedule settings

1. Specify the **Schedule Settings** to schedule the data syncs from your ClickHouse instance.

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack lets you schedule data syncs for your Warehouse Actions sources and specify how and when the syncs will run.
For more information on the <strong>Basic</strong>, <strong>CRON</strong>, and <strong>Manual</strong> schedule types, refer to the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/common-settings/sync-schedule-settings/">Sync Schedule Settings</a> guide.
</div>

2. After specifying the schedule type and run settings, click on **Continue** to finish the setup.

ClickHouse is now successfully configured as a source in your RudderStack dashboard. You can further connect this source to your preferred destination by clicking on **Add Destinations** button, as shown:

<img src="../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/destination.png" alt="Add destination in RudderStack" />

<div class="infoBlock">

If you have already configured a destination in RudderStack, choose the <strong>Use Existing Destination</strong> option which will take you to the `Schema` tab within the source settings. To add a new destination from scratch, select the <strong>Create New Destination</strong> option which will take you to the configuration settings of the destination.
</div>

## Specifying the data to import

While connecting a destination to your Warehouse Actions source, you can use the default JSON mapping or the [Visual Data Mapping](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/features/visual-data-mapper/) feature to map the warehouse columns to your destination fields.

<div class="infoBlock">

Based on the option (Table/Model) you chose while setting up the Warehouse Actions source, follow the relevant guide for detailed steps:

<ul>

</ul>
</div>

## FAQ

### What is the difference between the Table and Model options when creating a Warehouse Actions source?

When creating a new Warehouse Actions source, you are presented with the following two options from which RudderStack will sync the data:

<img src="../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/table-model-options.png" />

- When you choose **Table**, RudderStack imports all the data associated with the specified table during the sync.
- When you choose **Model**, RudderStack imports the data by running the query specified in the connected model, during the sync.
