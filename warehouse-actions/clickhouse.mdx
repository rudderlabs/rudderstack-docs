# ClickHouse

[ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.tech/) is an open-source, column-oriented database management system mainly used for online analytical processing \(OLAP\). It allows generating analytical reports using SQL queries that are updated in real-time. ClickHouse is highly scalable, fast, and built for high performance.

RudderStack supports ClickHouse as a source from which you can ingest enriched user information and route it to your desired downstream destinations.

## Setting up ClickHouse as source

The below section explains the detailed steps to set up ClickHouse as a source in RudderStack.

### Step 1: Naming the source

1. Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderlabs.com/signup?type=freetrial).

2. Select **Sources** from the left panel. Then, click on **New source**, as shown:

  - **Skip Verify** - Skips certificate verification. If you are using self-signed certificates, set this field to `true`.
  - **CA certificate** -  Certificate contents of the certificate which needs to be verified while establishing a secure connection.

## FAQ

### What do the three validations under Verifying Credentials imply?

When setting up a Warehouse Actions source, once you proceed after entering the connection credentials, you will see the following three validations under the **Verifying Credentials** option:

<img src="../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/validations.png" alt="Validations" />

These options are explained below:

* **Verifying Connection**: This option indicates that RudderStack is trying to connect to the warehouse with the information specified in the connection credentials. 

<div class="warningBlock">

If this option gives an error, it means that one or more fields specified in the connection credentials are incorrect. Verify your credentials in this case.
</div>

* **Able to List Schema**: This option checks if RudderStack is able to fetch all the schema details using the provided credentials. 
* **Able to Access RudderStack Schema**: This option implies that RudderStack is able to access the `_RUDDERSTACK` schema you have created by successfully running all the commands in the [**User Permissions**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/snowflake#granting-permissions) section. 

<div class="warningBlock">

If this option gives an error, verify if you have successfully created the <code class="inline-code">_RUDDERSTACK</code> schema and given RudderStack the required permissions to access it. For more information, refer to [this section](https://rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/snowflake#creating-the-rudderstack-schema-and-granting-permissions).
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

If you are trying to reuse the credentials for Warehouse Actions sources from before September 2021, you may run into the following permissions error:

<img src="../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/permissions-error.png" alt="Permissions error" />

As mentioned above, you will need to update your Snowflake account permissions by following the commands in [this section](https://rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/snowflake#creating-the-rudderstack-schema-and-granting-permissions).
