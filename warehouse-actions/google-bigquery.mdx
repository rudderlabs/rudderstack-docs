# Google BigQuery

[**Google BigQuery**](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) is an industry-leading, fully-managed cloud data warehouse that allows you to store and analyze petabytes of data in no time.

This guide will help you configure BigQuery as a source from which you can route event data to your desired destinations through RudderStack.

## Granting permissions

Follow these steps below to grant the necessary permissions for Warehouse Actions. For BigQuery, use the **BigQuery Console**.

### Creating the role and adding required permissions

* Go to [**https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/roles**](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/roles) and click on **CREATE ROLE**.
* Then, fill in the details as shown:

<img src="../../../images/assets/image1.png" />

* Next, click on **ADD PERMISSIONS** and add the permissions as listed in the following image:

<img src="../../../images/assets/image3.png" />

The permissions are as shown below:

```
bigquery.datasets.get
bigquery.jobs.create
bigquery.jobs.list
bigquery.tables.create
bigquery.tables.get
bigquery.tables.getData
bigquery.tables.list
bigquery.tables.update
bigquery.tables.updateData
```

* After adding all the required permissions, click on **CREATE**.

### Creating the service account & attaching the role to it

* Next, go to [**https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts**](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts).
* Select the project which has the dataset or the table that you want to use.
* Click on **CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT**.
* Fill in the details in Step **1** as shown below, and click **CREATE AND CONTINUE**:

<img src="../../../images/assets/image2.png" />

<div class="infoBlock">

Note down the **Service account ID**. This ID is required while creating the RudderStack schema and granting the required permissions to it.
</div>

* Then, fill in the details in Step **2** as shown below, and click **CONTINUE**:

<img src="../../../images/assets/image4.png" />

* After completing steps **1** and **2**, click on **DONE**. This will move you to the list of service accounts.

### Creating and downloading the JSON key

* Now, click on the three dots under **Actions** in the service account that you just created and select **Manage keys**, as shown:

* Click on **ADD KEY**, followed by **Create new key**, as shown:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59817155/133751255-356dab76-a795-4428-8e72-9c46b0031d79.png" />

* In the resulting pop-up, select **JSON** and click on **CREATE**.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59817155/133751286-a7897da9-eb9d-48ef-be29-f16f0e65e2bb.png" />

* Finally, download this JSON file. This file is required while creating a BigQuery warehouse source in RudderStack - the next section covers the steps to do this.

### Creating the RudderStack schema and granting permissions

* The following command creates a dedicated schema `rudderstack_` used by RudderStack for storing the state of each data sync.

```
create schema rudderstack_;
```

* The following query allows the service account `Rudderstack` to have full access to the schema `rudderstack_` \(used by RudderStack\).

```
GRANT `roles/bigquery.dataOwner`
     ON SCHEMA rudderstack_
     TO "serviceAccount:<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID>";
```

## Setting up the source

To set up Google BigQuery as a source in RudderStack, follow these steps:

* Log into your <a href="https://app.rudderstack.com">**RudderStack dashboard**</a>.

* From the left panel, select **Sources**. Then, click on **New Source** in the top right corner.

* Click on **Warehouse Sources** and select **BigQuery**, as shown:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59817155/138218312-55411916-3e24-4b08-bfad-7180e5f604e0.png" alt="BigQuery" />

### Setting up the connection

* Assign a name for your source and click on **Create Credentials from Scratch**.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59817155/138218620-a3849ac6-b316-476d-92b0-dfa892b2ba0f.png" />

<div class="successBlock">

If you have already configured Google BigQuery as a source before, the existing credentials will automatically appear under **Use Existing Credentials**.
</div>

* Next, enter the BigQuery **Project**. Also, paste the **Credentials** JSON obtained by following the [**Creating and downloading the JSON key**](#creating-and-downloading-the-JSON-key) section above. RudderStack will use this JSON to import the data from your BigQuery instance.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59817155/138219388-2d79154d-3b1e-4f4c-976a-9bd2b050209c.png" />

### Setting the data update schedule

* Next, you will be required to set the **Run Frequency** to schedule the data import from your BigQuery project to RudderStack.

* Optionally, can also specify the time when you want this synchronization to start, by choosing the time under the **Sync Starting At** option. Then, click on **Next**.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59817155/138219597-5ed8025c-93fc-457c-a35b-74b33d0c922f.png" />

That's it! BigQuery is now successfully configured as a source on your RudderStack dashboard.

## Specifying the data to import

Once you have set up the BigQuery source, you can connect it to an existing or new destination via the **Add Destination** button, as shown:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59817155/138221676-022211fb-9f01-44da-ad24-7ce41fbe4da5.png" />

Then, follow these steps:

* Select the **Schema** and the **Table** from which you want RudderStack to import the data. You can also select the user identifiers (**user_id**/**anonymous_id**) from the dropdown list, as shown:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59817155/138225293-7452e0a4-6f3a-4cc1-a354-8c6c2b111572.png" />

<div class="successBlock">

For [**HubSpot**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/crm/hubspot/), [**Salesforce**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/crm/salesforce/), [**Mailchimp**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/marketing/mailchimp/), and [**Braze**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/destinations//marketing/braze/) destinations, you can also use the [**Visual Data Mapper**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/visual-data-mapper/) functionality to map your warehouse columns to specific destination fields.
</div>

Once you specify the table containing the required columns, you will be able to preview a snippet of your data. Here, you can search the columns by a specific keyword and select all or only specific columns of your choice. You can also edit the **JSON Trait Key** and  preview the resultant JSON on the right, as shown:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59817155/138226097-025a730f-e87c-4d56-8e93-1d1d2089114d.png" />

* Once you have selected the required table columns to import the data, click on the **Save** button on the top right side of the configuration window.

RudderStack will then start importing the data from your BigQuery table as per the specified frequency.

## FAQ

### What do the three validations under Verifying Credentials imply?

When setting up a Warehouse Actions source, once you proceed after entering the connection credentials, you will see the following three validations under the **Verifying Credentials** option:

<img src="../../../images/assets/validations.png" />

These options are explained below:

* **Verifying Connection**: This option indicates that RudderStack is trying to connect to the warehouse with the information specified in the connection credentials. 

<div class="warningBlock">

If this option gives an error, it means that one or more fields specified in the connection credentials are incorrect. Verify your credentials in this case.
</div>

* **Able to List Schema**: This option checks if RudderStack is able to fetch all the schema details using the provided credentials. 
* **Able to Access RudderStack Schema**: This option implies that RudderStack is able to access the `rudderstack_` schema that you have created by successfully running all the commands in the [**User Permissions**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/warehouse-actions/google-bigquery#granting-permissions) section. 

<div class="warningBlock">

If this option gives an error, verify if you have successfully created the `rudderstack_` schema and given RudderStack the required permissions to access it. For more information, refer to [**this section**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/warehouse-actions/google-bigquery#creating-the-rudderstack-schema-and-granting-permissions).
