# Google BigQuery

[Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) is an industry-leading, fully-managed cloud data warehouse that lets you store and analyze petabytes of data in no time.

RudderStack supports Google BigQuery as a source from which you can ingest data and route it to your desired downstream destinations.

## Granting permissions

RudderStack requires you to grant certain user permissions on your Snowflake warehouse to successfully access data from it.

Run the below-mentioned SQL queries on the **BigQuery Console** in the **exact** order to grant these necessary permissions:

### Step 1: Creating a role and granting permissions

1. Go to the [Roles](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/roles) section of Google Cloud Platform dashboard and click on **CREATE ROLE**.

2. Fill in the details as shown:

<img src="../assets/image1.png" />

3. Click on **ADD PERMISSIONS** and add the permissions as listed in the following image:

<img src="../assets/image3.png" />

The permissions are as shown below:

```
bigquery.datasets.get
bigquery.jobs.create
bigquery.jobs.list
bigquery.tables.create
bigquery.tables.get
bigquery.tables.getData
bigquery.tables.list
bigquery.tables.update
bigquery.tables.updateData
```

4. Finally, click on **CREATE**.

### Creating a service account & attaching the role to it

1. Go to [Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) and select the project which has the dataset or the table that you want to use.
2. Click on **CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT**.

<img src="../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/GCP-service-account.png" />

3. Fill in the **Service Account details** as shown below, and click on **CREATE AND CONTINUE**:

<img src="../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/image2.png" />

<div class="infoBlock">

Note down the **Service account ID**. This ID is required while creating the RudderStack schema and granting the required permissions to it.
</div>

4. Fill in the Role details as shown below, and click on **CONTINUE**:

<img src="../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/image4.png" />

5. Click on **DONE** to move to the list of service accounts.

### Creating and downloading the JSON key

1. Click on the three dots icon under **Actions** in the service account that you just created and select **Manage keys**, as shown:

<img src="../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/manage-keys.png" />

2. Click on **ADD KEY**, followed by **Create new key**, as shown:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59817155/133751255-356dab76-a795-4428-8e72-9c46b0031d79.png" />

3. Select **JSON** and click on **CREATE**.

<img src="../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/create-new-key.png" />

A JSON file will be downloaded on your system. This file is required while creating a BigQuery warehouse source in RudderStack, explained further in this document.

### Creating the RudderStack schema and granting permissions

1. Go to the [BigQuery SQL workspace](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery) and run the following command to create a dedicated schema `rudderstack_` for storing the state of each data sync.

```sql
create schema rudderstack_;
```

2. Grant full access to the `rudderstack_` \(used by RudderStack\) schema over the `Rudderstack` service account.

```sql
GRANT `roles/bigquery.dataOwner`
     ON SCHEMA rudderstack_
     TO "serviceAccount:<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID>";
```
## Setting up BigQuery as source in RudderStack

To set up BigQuery as a source in RudderStack, follow these steps:

### Naming the source

1. Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).
2. From the left navigation bar, go to **Source** > **New Source** > **Warehouse Actions**.  Then, select **BigQuery**, as shown:

<img src="../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/select-source.png" alt="Select warehouse source in RudderStack" />

3. Assign a name to your source.

### Configuring the connection credentials

1. Choose the relevant option from **Table** or **Model** to use the source to sync either a table or a model.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the difference between the <strong>Table</strong> and <strong>Model</strong> options when creating a Warehouse Actions source, refer to the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section below.
</div>

2. Enter the relevant settings in the **Connection Credentials** section as listed below:

<img src="../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/bigquery-connection-settings.png" />

- **Credentials** - Enter the GCP Service Account credentials JSON.
- **Project ID** - Enter the GCP Project ID where your BigQuery database is located.
- **Service account** - Enter the service account ID.

<div class="successBlock">

If you've configured BigQuery as a source before, you can select the existing credentials from <strong>Use existing credentials</strong> option.

</div>

3. Click on **Continue** to verify your credentials. RudderStack will then verify and validate your credentials. 

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on these validation steps, refer to the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section. 
</div>

4. Once verified, click on **Continue** to proceed.

### Schedule settings

1. Specify the **Schedule Settings** to schedule the data syncs from your Snowflake instance.

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack lets you schedule data syncs for your Warehouse Actions sources and specify how and when the syncs will run. For more information on the <strong>Basic</strong>, <strong>CRON</strong>, and <strong>Manual</strong> schedule types, refer to the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/common-settings/sync-schedule-settings/">Sync Schedule Settings</a> guide.
</div>

2. After specifying the schedule type and run settings, click on **Continue** to finish the setup.

BigQuery is now successfully configured as a source in your RudderStack dashboard. You can further connect this source to your preferred destination by clicking on **Add Destinations** button, as shown:

<img src="../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/destination.png" alt="Add destination in RudderStack" />

<div class=“infoBlock”>
     
If you have already configured a destination in RudderStack, choose the <strong>Use Existing Destination</strong> option which will take you to the <strong>Schema</strong> tab in the source settings. To add a new destination from scratch, select the <strong>Create New Destination</strong> option which will take you to the destination configuration page.
</div>

## Specifying the data to import

While connecting a destination to your Warehouse Actions source, you can use the default JSON mapping or the [Visual Data Mapping](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/features/visual-data-mapper/) feature to map the warehouse columns to your destination fields.

<div class="infoBlock">

Based on the option (Table/Model) you chose while setting up the Warehouse Actions source, follow the relevant guide for detailed steps:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/common-settings/importing-data-using-tables/">Importing Data using Tables</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/common-settings/importing-data-using-models/">Importing Data using Models</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
     
## FAQ

### What is the difference between the Table and Model options when creating a Warehouse Actions source?

When creating a new Warehouse Actions source, you are presented with the following two options from which RudderStack will sync the data:

<img src="../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/table-model-options.png" />

- When you choose **Table**, RudderStack imports all the data associated with the specified table during the sync.
- When you choose **Model**, RudderStack imports the data by running the query specified in the connected model, during the sync.

### What do the three validations under Verifying Credentials imply?

When setting up a Warehouse Actions source, once you proceed after entering the connection credentials, you will see the following three validations under the **Verifying Credentials** option:

<img src="../assets/validations.png" />

These options are explained below:

* **Verifying Connection**: This option indicates that RudderStack is trying to connect to the warehouse with the information specified in the connection credentials. 

<div class="warningBlock">

If this option gives an error, it means that one or more fields specified in the connection credentials are incorrect. Verify your credentials in this case.
</div>

* **Able to List Schema**: This option checks if RudderStack is able to fetch all the schema details using the provided credentials. 
* **Able to Access RudderStack Schema**: This option implies that RudderStack is able to access the `rudderstack_` schema that you have created by successfully running all the commands in the [**User Permissions**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/google-bigquery#granting-permissions) section. 

<div class="warningBlock">

If this option gives an error, verify if you have successfully created the `rudderstack_` schema and given RudderStack the required permissions to access it. For more information, refer to [**this section**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/google-bigquery#creating-the-rudderstack-schema-and-granting-permissions).
