# Amazon Redshift

[Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) is the world's fastest cloud data warehouse. It allows you to handle large analytical workloads with best-in-class performance, speed, and efficiency. With Redshift, you don't have to worry about the scale of your data or the cost of running queries on them.

This guide will help you configure Redshift as a source from which you can route event data to your desired destinations through RudderStack.

## Granting Permissions

Run the SQL queries below in the **exact** order to grant the necessary permissions for the Warehouse Actions source:

### Creating the user

* The following command creates a new user `rudder` with password `<strong_unique_password>` in Redshift.

```
CREATE USER rudder WITH PASSWORD '<strong_unique_password>';
```

#### Password considerations for Redshift

The password you set in the above command must meet the following conditions:

* It should be **8-64** characters in length
* It must contain atleast one upper case, one lower case, and one number
* It can contain any ASCII characters with the ASCII codes 33-126, with the exception of `'` \(single quotation mark\), `"` \(double quotation mark\), `\`, `/`, and `@`.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the password rules, refer to the [**Amazon Redshift documentation**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_CREATE_USER.html#r_CREATE_USER-parameters).
</div>

### Creating the RudderStack schema and granting permissions

* The following command creates a dedicated schema `_rudderstack` used by RudderStack for storing the state of each data sync.

```
CREATE SCHEMA "_rudderstack";
```

<div class="warningBlock">

The `_rudderstack` schema is used by RudderStack. Its name **should not** be changed.
</div>

* The following command allows the user `rudder` to have full access to the schema `_rudderstack`.

```
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA "_rudderstack" TO rudder;
```

* The following command allows the user `rudder` to have full access to all the objects that exist in the schema `_rudderstack`.

```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA "_rudderstack" TO rudder;
```

### Granting permissions on your schema and table

* The following command allows the user `rudder` to look up objects within the schema `<YOUR_SCHEMA>`. Replace `<YOUR_SCHEMA>` with the exact name of your Redshift schema.

```
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "<YOUR_SCHEMA>" TO rudder;
```

* The following command allows the user `rudder` to read the data from specified table `<YOUR_TABLE>`. Replace `<YOUR_SCHEMA>` and `<YOUR_TABLE>` with the exact names of your Redshift schema and table.

```
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE "<YOUR_SCHEMA>"."<YOUR_TABLE>" TO rudder;
```

* The following **optional** command allows the user `rudder` to view and read the data from all the tables present in the schema `<YOUR_SCHEMA>`:

```
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA "<YOUR_SCHEMA>" TO rudder;
```

<div class="warningBlock">

Run the above command only if you're okay with RudderStack being able to access the data in all the tables residing within your specified schema.
</div>

* The following **optional** command allows the user `rudder` to read the data from all the future tables in the schema `<YOUR_SCHEMA>`:

```
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA "<YOUR_SCHEMA>" GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO rudder;
```

<div class="warningBlock">

Run the above command only if you're okay with RudderStack being able to access the data in all the future tables residing within your specified schema.
</div>

<img src="../../../images/assets/screen-shot-2021-01-06-at-4.05.51-pm (1) (1) (1) (1) (2) (2) (3) (2) (1).png" alt="JSON Trait Key" />

That's it! Redshift is now successfully configured as a source on your RudderStack dashboard.

RudderStack will start importing data from your Redshift instance as per the specified frequency. You can further connect this source to your preferred destination by clicking on **Connect Destinations** or **Add Destinations**, as shown:

<!--![](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2021-01-06-at-4.06.07-pm.png)-->

<img src="../../../images/assets/screen-shot-2021-01-06-at-4.06.07-pm.png" alt="Connect Destinations" />

<div class="infoBlock">

If you have already configured a destination on the RudderStack platform, choose the **Connect Destinations** option. To add a new destination from scratch, you can select the **Add Destination** option.
</div>

## FAQ

### What do the three validations under Verifying Credentials imply?

When setting up a Warehouse Actions source, once you proceed after entering the connection credentials, you will see the following three validations under the **Verifying Credentials** option:

<!--![](../.gitbook/assets/validations.png)-->

<img src="../../../images/assets/validations.png" alt="Verifying Credentials" />

These options are explained below:

* **Verifying Connection**: This option indicates that RudderStack is trying to connect to the warehouse with the information specified in the connection credentials. 

<div class="warningBlock">

If this option gives an error, it means that one or more fields specified in the connection credentials are incorrect. Verify your credentials in this case.
</div>

* **Able to List Schema**: This option checks if RudderStack is able to fetch all the schema details using the provided credentials. 
* **Able to Access RudderStack Schema**: This option implies that RudderStack is able to access the `_rudderstack` schema that you have created by successfully running all the commands in the [**User Permissions**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/amazon-redshift#creating-the-rudderstack-schema-and-granting-permissions) section. 

<div class="warningBlock">

If this option gives an error, verify if you have successfully created the `_rudderstack` schema and given RudderStack the required permissions to access it. For more information, refer to [**this section**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/amazon-redshift#creating-the-rudderstack-schema-and-granting-permissions).
