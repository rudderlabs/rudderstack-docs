# Sync Configuration Settings

This guide lists the settings required by RudderStack to import and sync the warehouse data to your specified destination.

<div class="infoBlock">

This guide is applicable for Warehouse Actions sources configured using a <strong>warehouse table</strong>. For steps on setting up the Warehouse Actions source using a model, refer to the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/features/setting-up-connections-using-models/">Setting up Connections Using Models</a> guide.
</div>

## Data import settings

Once you connect a destination to your Warehouse Actions source, you will automatically be redirected to the **Schema** tab within the source settings, as shown:

The settings are listed below:

- **Schema**: Specify the warehouse schema from which you want RudderStack to import the data.
- **Table**: Specify the table residing within the above schema.
- **Choose user identifier**: Select the columns which RudderStack should use as the `user_id` and/or `anonymous_id`.

<div class="warningBlock">

Your table must include one of the following columns: <code class="inline-code">email</code>, <code class="inline-code">user_id</code>, or <code class="inline-code">anonymous_id</code>.
</div>

- Once you specify the table, you can select the sync mode that RudderStack uses to sync your data.

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack currently supports two modes for syncing your data - <strong>Upsert</strong> and <strong>Mirror mode</strong>. For more information on these modes, refer to the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/common-settings/sync-modes/">Sync Modes</a> guide.
</div>

- You will also be able to preview a snippet of your data, as shown:

- Here, you can select all or only specific columns of your choice, search the columns by a keyword, and also edit the **JSON Trait Key**. You can also preview the resultant JSON on the right.

## Add Constant setting

You can also use the **Add Constant** option that lets you add a constant key-value pair which is always sent in the JSON payload, as shown:

Once you have finalized the configuration, click on **Save**.

## Updating an existing configuration

To update an existing configuration, go to the **Schema** tab of your configured source and click on the **Update** button on the top right.
