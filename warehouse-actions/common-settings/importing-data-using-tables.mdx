# Importing Data using Tables

This guide lists the settings required to import and sync data from your warehouse table to the specified destination.

<div class="infoBlock">

This guide is applicable for Warehouse Actions sources configured using the <strong>Table</strong> option. For more information on the data import settings for models, refer to the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/features/setting-up-connections-using-models/">Importing Data using Models</a> guide.
</div>

## Data import settings

The settings to import and sync data from your warehouse table are listed below:

- **Schema**: Specify your warehouse schema.
- **Table**: Specify the table residing within the above schema from which you want RudderStack to import the data.
- **Sync mode**: Select the sync mode that RudderStack uses to sync your data.

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack currently supports two modes for syncing your data - <strong>Upsert</strong> and <strong>Mirror</strong>. For more information on these modes, refer to the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/common-settings/sync-modes/">Sync Modes</a> guide.

- **Choose user identifier**: Choose atleast one user identifier from `user_id` and `anonymous_id` from the dropdown.
- You will also be able to preview a snippet of your data, as shown:

- Here, you can select all or only specific columns of your choice, search the columns by a keyword, and also edit the **JSON Trait Key**. You can also preview the resulting JSON on the right.

<div class="infoBlock">

Alternatively, you can map the columns using the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/features/visual-data-mapper/">Visual Data Mapper</a> feature. However, note that this feature is currently supported only for selective destinations.

## Add Constant

You can also use the **Add Constant** option to add a constant key-value pair which is always sent in the JSON payload, as shown:

4. Finally, click on the **Save** button.
