# Sync Modes

All the Warehouse Actions sources currently support two modes that let you define how you want to sync your data. These are **Upsert** and **Mirror mode**.

The following sections explain these data sync modes in detail.

## Upsert

In this mode, RudderStack supports insertion of new records and updates to the existing records, while syncing data to the destination.

<div class="infoBlock">

A full sync is run whenever the column mapping is changed.
</div>

## Mirror mode

<div class="infoBlock">

This mode is currently supported only for the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/advertising/fb-custom-audience/">Facebook Custom Audience</a> destination.
</div>

In this mode, RudderStack supports insertion, updates, and deletion of records while syncing data to the destination.

<div class="infoBlock">

When performing a full sync in the mirror mode, RudderStack first deletes all the existing records. Then, it syncs the records as per the latest column mappings.
