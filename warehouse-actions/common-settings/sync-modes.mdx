# Sync Modes

All the Warehouse Actions sources currently support two modes - **Upsert** and **Mirror mode** - that let you define how you want to sync your data.

## Upsert

In this mode, RudderStack supports only insertion of new records as well as updating existing records, while syncing data to the destination.

<div class="infoBlock">

A full sync is run whenever column mapping is changed for the data sync.
</div>

## Mirror mode

<div class="infoBlock">

This mode is supported only for the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/advertising/fb-custom-audience/">Facebook Custom Audience</a> destination.
</div>

In this mode, RudderStack supports inserts, updates, and deletion of records while syncing data to the destination.

<div class="infoBlock">

When performing a full sync in the mirror mode, RudderStack first deletes all the existing records. Then, it syncs the records as per the latest column mappings.
