# Track

The `track` call lets you record the customer events, i.e. the actions that they perform, along with any properties associated with them.

<div class="infoBlock">

Each user action is called an event. Every event has a name associated with it, e.g. **Product Reviewed**. This event might also have some properties associated with it, like <code class="inline-code">review_id</code> and <code class="inline-code">rating</code>.
</div>

<div class="successBlock">

  For E-Commerce specific events, refer to our <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-ecommerce-events-specification/">E-Commerce Events Specification</a> guide.
</div>

## Sample payload

A sample payload for the `track` event after removing the common fields mentioned in the [**Common Fields**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/common-fields/) section is as shown:

```javascript
{
  "type": "track",
  "event": "Product Reviewed",
  "properties": {
    "review_id": "12345",
    "product_id" : "123",
    "rating" : 3.0,
    "review_body" : "Average product, expected much more."
  }
}
```

The corresponding event that generates the above payload via the [**JavaScript SDK**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Product Reviewed", {
  review_id: "12345",
  product_id: "123",
  rating: 3.0,
  review_body: "Average product, expected much more."
})
```

## Track fields

Apart from the [**Common Fields**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/common-fields/), the `track` call accepts the following fields:

| **Field**    | **Type** | **Presence** | **Description**                                                                                                  |
| :----------- | :------- | :----------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `event`      | String   | Required     | Name of the user action.                                                                                         |
| `properties` | Object   | Optional     | Includes the properties associated with the event. For more information, check the [**Properties**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/track/#properties) section below. |

## Properties

Properties are additional contextual information that are associated with a `track` event, that give more clarity of your users' actions.

RudderStack has reserved some standard properties listed in the following table and handles them in a special manner.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">
        <b>Property</b>
      </th>
      <th style="text-align:left">
        <b>Type</b>
      </th>
      <th style="text-align:left">
        <b>Description</b>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <code class="inline-code">revenue</code>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">Number</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>The revenue amount as a result of an event. For e.g., a product worth $20.00 would result in a <code class="inline-code">revenue</code> of <code class="inline-code">20.00</code>.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <code class="inline-code">currency</code>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">String</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>The currency of the revenue as a result of the event, set in ISO 4127 format. If this is not set, RudderStack assumes the revenue is in USD.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <code class="inline-code">value</code>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">String</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>An abstract value associated with an event, to be used by various teams.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<div class="successBlock">
  
  Different destinations recognize some of the above traits differently. For example, Mixpanel has a <code class="inline-code">track_charges</code> method for tracking revenue. With RudderStack, you don't have to worry about these inconsistencies. In this case, you can pass the <code class="inline-code">revenue</code> property and RudderStack will handle the conversion automatically.
