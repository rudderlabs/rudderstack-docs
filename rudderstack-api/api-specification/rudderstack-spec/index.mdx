# RudderStack Event Specification

The **RudderStack API Spec** helps you plan your event data and provides various options for tracking your events across all the RudderStack SDKs and APIs.

<div class="successBlock">

  RudderStack has a unified event semantic for different destination platforms.
  You can easily translate your event data to different downstream tools by
  following this spec.
</div>

## Supported API Calls

The RudderStack API Spec supports the following calls, each answering a pertinent question about the user:

| **API Call**                                 | **Description**                                                                           |
| :------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**Identify**](identify/)  | Captures the details about the user.                                                      |
| [**Page**](page/)          | Captures the details related to the web page that the user is currently on.               |
| [**Screen**](screen/)      | Captures the details related to the app screen that the user is currently viewing.        |
| [**Track**](track/)        | Captures information related to the user's actions.                                       |
| [**Group**](group/)        | Captures the relevant details about the group or organization that the user is a part of. |
| [**Alias**](alias/)        | Captures any relevant details about the user's alternate/past identity.                   |
| **Reset**                                    | Resets the information related to the previously identified user.                         |

## How the API Calls Work

Here's a quick overview of how the API calls mentioned above work:

1. When the user makes the API calls, the event data is sent to the RudderStack backend.
2. RudderStack transforms this event data into a destination-specific format.
3. The transformed data is then forwarded to the required destination.

## Event Data Format

The event data collected by RudderStack has a JSON structure, which has [**common fields**](common-fields/) and an API-specific payload.
