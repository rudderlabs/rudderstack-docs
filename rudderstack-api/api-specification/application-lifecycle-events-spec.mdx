# Application Lifecycle Events Specification

RudderStack lets you track various application lifecycle events across the mobile SDKs and get insights into app-related metrics like installs, opens, etc. This guide provides the details and semantic definitions of these events and the associated properties.

<div class="warningBlock">

The Unity SDK currently does not support tracking the application lifecycle events on the Android platform.
</div>

## Supported lifecycle events

RudderStack **automatically tracks** the following application lifecycle events:

- [Application Installed](#application-installed)
- [Application Opened](#application-opened)
- [Application Updated](#application-updated)
- [Application Backgrounded](#application-backgrounded)

<div class="infoBlock">

To disable the auto-tracking of these events, set the <code class="inline-code">withTrackLifecycleEvents</code> parameter to <code class="inline-code">false</code> while initializing the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-android-sdk/#initializing-the-rudderstack-client">Android</a> / <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-ios-sdk/#initializing-the-rudderstack-client">iOS</a> SDK.
</div>

## Application Installed

This event is fired when a user opens an application for the first time after installation.

<div class="warningBlock">

RudderStack does not collect this event if the user does not open the app after installation.
</div>

A sample payload is shown below:

```json
{
  "type": "track",
  "event": "Application Installed",
  "properties": {
    "version": "11.1.7"
  }
}
```

RudderStack tracks the following properties for this event:

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--------| :-----| :------------|
| `version` | String | The version of the installed application. |

## Application Opened

This event is fired when a user launches an application after the first launch and subsequently every time the app is reopened after it is closed or backgrounded.

A sample payload is shown below:

```json
{
  "userId": "1hKOmRA4el9Z",
  "type": "track",
  "event": "Application Opened",
  "properties": {
    "from_background": false,
    "referring_application": "Whatsapp",
    "url": "https://www.estore.com/best-seller/1",
    "version": "11.1.7"
  }
}
```


<div class="infoBlock">
  
  <code class="inline-code">userId</code> will be present only if the user is logged into the application, i.e. an <code class="inline-code">identify</code> call is made previously.
</div>

RudderStack tracks the following properties for this event:

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--------| :-----| :------------|
| `from_background` | Boolean | Determines if the app was backgrounded initially or if it is a fresh open.  |
| `url`* | String | The deep linking URL with which the user was directed into the app. |
| `referring_application`* | String | The external application from which the user was referred to the app. |
| `version`* | String | The version of the installed application. |

There are some differences in the way the RudderStack SDKs handle the above event properties:

### Android SDK

- The properties marked with an asterisk (`url`, `referring_application`, `version`) are tracked and sent only if they are available on the first launch of the application.
- RudderStack also sends all the query parameters received as a part of the deep linking URL as key-value pairs in the `Application Opened` event properties.

### iOS SDK

- The properties marked with an asterisk (`url`, `referring_application`, `version`) are tracked and sent only if they are available on every application launch.

### Unity SDK

| Platform | Expected behavior |
| :--------| :---|
| Android | **Currently not supported**. | 
| iOS | Same behavior as the [iOS SDK](#ios-sdk). |

### React Native SDK

| Platform | Expected behavior |
| :--------| :---|
| Android | RudderStack **does not track** the properties marked with an asterisk (`url`, `referring_application`, `version`). | 
| iOS | The properties marked with an asterisk are tracked only if they are available on every application launch. |

### Flutter SDK

| Platform | Expected behavior |
| :--------| :---|
| Android | **No properties** are tracked. | 
| iOS | The properties marked with an asterisk (`url`, `referring_application`, `version`)  are tracked only if they are available on every application launch. |

### Cordova SDK

| Platform | Expected behavior |
| :--------| :---|
| Android | Same behavior as the [Android SDK](#android-sdk). | 
| iOS | Same behavior as the [iOS SDK](#ios-sdk). |

## Application Updated

This event is fired when a user updates their application.

A sample payload is shown below:

```json
{
  "userId": "1hKOmRA4el9Z",
  "type": "track",
  "event": "Application Updated",
  "properties": {
    "previous_version": "11.1.7",
    "version": "12.0.1"
  }
}
```

RudderStack tracks the following properties for this event:

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--------| :-----| :------------|
| `previous_version` | String | The application version before it was updated.  |
| `version` | String | The current version of the application after it is updated. |

## Application Backgrounded

This event is fired when the user backgrounds the application.

A sample payload is shown below:

```json
{
  "userId": "1hKOmRA4el9Z",
  "type": "track",
  "event": "Application Backgrounded",
  "properties": {}
}
```

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack does not track any properties for this event.
</div>

## FAQ

### Do the application lifecycle events follow the standard timestamping format?

Yes, the lifecycle events follow the timestamp format in accordance with the [RudderStack API Spec](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/common-fields/).

### Do the lifecycle events include the user traits or `context` objects?

The application lifecycle events include the `context` objects. Note that `userId` would be present only if the user is logged into the application, i.e. an `identify` call is made previously.
