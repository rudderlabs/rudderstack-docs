## What is data regulation?

At RudderStack, we respect the users' data privacy choices. 

You can leverage RudderStack's data regulation feature to suppress any incoming data for a given user. RudderStack will drop the events for that user at source - these events will not be shown in any of the debuggers and will not be forwarded to any destinations. 

You can also use this feature to direct RudderStack to suppress any incoming events for a user and delete any collected data in a given destination.

<div class="warningBlock">

Once a user is suppressed, replaying the user events is not possible.
</div>

## Prerequisites

To use the Data Regulation API successfully, you need to generate a [**Personal Access Token**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/api-access-token/). This is required to authenticate the API.

## API authorization

The Data Regulation API uses the **Bearer Token Authentication** for authenticating all the requests.

<div class="infoBlock">

The Personal Access Token should be used as the bearer token for authentication.

## Adding a new data regulation

This request allows you to add a new data regulation required to suppress/suppress and delete a given user's data.

* **Request Type**: **POST**

* **Request Format**: 

```bash
https://api.rudderstack.com/v2/regulations
```

* **Request Body**:

```json
{
  "regulationType": "suppress/suppress_with_delete",
  "destinationIds": [],
  "sourceIds": [],
  "users": [{
    "userId": "<user_ID>",
    "phone": "<phone_number>",
    "email": "<user_email>"
  }]
}
```
### `regulationType`

This field lets you define the type of data regulation you want to add. It supports the following values:

| Parameter Name | Description |
| :-----------------| :-----------|
| `suppress`           | Directs RudderStack to suppress the incoming user data. |
| `suppress_with_delete` | Directs RudderStack to suppress any incoming user data and delete any events from the destinations configured by the user. |

### `destinationIds` and `sourceIds`

You can set these **optional** fields to specify the sources/destinations from which the data should be suppressed or deleted. 

<div class="infoBlock">
<ul>
<li>Use the <code class="inline-code">https://api.rudderstack.com/v2/sources</code> endpoint to get the source IDs. </li>
<li>Use the <code class="inline-code">https://api.rudderstack.com/v2/destinations</code> endpoint to get the destination IDs. </li>
</ul>
</div>

### `users`

The API lets you specify the users for whom you want to set the data regulation. These users can be identified either by their `userId`, `phone`, or `email`.

<div class="infoBlock">

  <strong>Only <code class="inline-code">userId</code> is a mandatory field</strong>. The other fields are optional as some destinations require fields like phone number or email to associate a given user and do not strictly associate a user by their user ID.
</div>

<div class="warningBlock">

We recommend that you provide the user's <code class="inline-code">phone</code> and <code class="inline-code">email</code> <strong>at your own discretion and only if it is required</strong>.
</div>
