# Personal Access Tokens

To consume all the public RudderStack APIs, you will need an access token associated with your RudderStack account. This guide describes the steps to generate a **personal access token** and the operations associated with it.

## Generating a personal access token

Follow these steps to generate a personal access token:

1. Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).
2. Go to **Settings** > **Personal access tokens**, as shown

4. Enter your **Token name** and select the permissions (**Role**) associated with this token, from the dropdown:

Make sure you copy the generated token. You will not be able to see the token details again once you close this window.

## Deleting a personal access token

To delete an existing token, click on the corresponding **Delete** option next to that token, and confirm by clicking on **Yes, delete**.

To delete all the existing tokens, click on the **Revoke all** button on the top right and click on **Yes, delete**.
