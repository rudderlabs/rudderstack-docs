# Models

The **Models** feature lets you create models by defining custom SQL queries. These queries can then be executed over the Warehouse sources schema to send the resultant data to the specified destinations. You can create as many models and reuse them with their corresponding Warehouse Actions sources.

<div class="infoBlock">

  Currently, the <strong>Models</strong> feature is supported for <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/amazon-redshift/">Amazon Redshift</a>, <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/google-bigquery/">Google BigQuery</a>, <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/postgresql/">PostgreSQL</a>, and <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/snowflake/">Snowflake</a> Warehouse Actions sources only.

The RudderStack dashboard provides **Models** option in the left navigation bar that allows you to view all the existing models:
