# Models

RudderStack's **Models** feature lets you create models by defining custom SQL queries. You can then execute these queries over your warehouse to send the resultant data to specific destinations. You can create as many models and reuse them with their corresponding Warehouse Actions sources.

<div class="infoBlock">

Currently, the <strong>Models</strong> feature is supported for <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/amazon-redshift/">Amazon Redshift</a>, <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/google-bigquery/">Google BigQuery</a>, <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/postgresql/">PostgreSQL</a>, and <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/snowflake/">Snowflake</a> Warehouse Actions sources only.
</div>

The RudderStack dashboard provides **Models** option in the left navigation bar that allows you to view all the existing models:

<div class="infoBlock">
Once a model is created, you can use it to send the data from a warehouse source to a specified destination. For more information and detailed steps, refer to <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/setting-connections-using-models/">Setting Connections using Models</a>.
</div>

## Update model

2. Click on **Edit Configuration** and make the required changes in  **Description** and/or **Query**.

<div class="infoBlock">
  
If you update a model's <strong>Query</strong>, you also need to check/update the JSON Mapper or <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/visual-data-mapper/">Visual Data Mapper</a> mapping to trigger the full sync and validate a sync by manually triggering it.
</div>

## Model details

To get details about an existing model, you can click on it to see the options listed below:

- **Rename**: Lets you rename the model by clicking on the edit icon next to the model's name.

- **Sources**: Displays the sources associated with the model. To know more on how to use a model with a source, refer to [Setting Connections using Models](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/warehouse-actions/setting-connections-using-models/).

- **Configuration**: Displays and lets you edit the SQL **Query** and **Description**.

- **Settings**: This option provides additional model-related details, such as:

   - **Permanently delete the model**: Lets you delete the model by clicking on the **Delete** button. The **Delete** button is only enabled when no source is using the model.
   - - **Credentials**: Lets you edit the credentials used for the model.

<div class="infoBlock">

After editing the credentials, it is recommended to validate the query by running it and fetching its preview using the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab.
