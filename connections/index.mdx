# Connections

RudderStack lets you set up connections between your preferred event data sources and destinations. With this feature, you can build efficient data pipelines across your entire customer data stack.

<div class="successBlock">

  **
    With RudderStack, you can bring together all your event data across your
    web, mobile, server-side, and cloud apps and route this data reliably to
    your data warehouse and other third-party platforms of your choice.
  **

## Sources

A **source** refers to a platform or an application \(web, mobile, server-side, or a third-party cloud app\) from where RudderStack tracks and collects your event data.

<div class="successBlock">

  We recommend creating a source for every unique source of data. You can also
  create multiple sources for each website or application from which you want to
  track the data.
</div>

To view all the configured sources in your RudderStack dashboard, click on **Sources** in the left navigation bar, as shown:

<!-- <img src="../assets/3 (20).png" /> -->

<img src="../assets/3 (20).png" alt="Sources" />

<div class="successBlock">

  You can add a new source by simply clicking on the **Add Source**
  button. For more details on adding a source in RudderStack, refer to the guide
  on <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/">Adding a Source and Destination in RudderStack</a>.
</div>

### Source Details

To get more details on the configured source, click on it. You should then see the following view on the dashboard:

<!-- <img src="../assets/4 (20).png" /> -->

<img src="../assets/4 (20).png" alt="Source Details" />

The options you see in this page are as follows:

- **Source ID**: The unique identifier associated with your source.
- **Write Key**: The write key is required to send the data from your source.

<div class="successBlock">
As an example, you can load <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/">RudderStack's JavaScript SDK</a> on your web pages to track and collect the events by running the following:

<code class="inline-code">
  rudderanalytics.load(&lt;YOUR_WRITE_KEY&gt;, &lt;DATA_PLANE_URL&gt;, options);
</code>

</div>

- **Add Destination**: You can connect your source to a new destination by clicking on this button.

<div class="successBlock">

  If you have already configured a destination in RudderStack, you should click
  on the **Connect Destination** button.
</div>

- **Live Events**: Once your source and destination are successfully configured and a connection is set up and enabled, RudderStack starts tracking and collecting events from your source. These events can be viewed in real-time using this option.

### Deleting a Source

You can delete a source by clicking on the **Delete Source** button.

<div class="warningBlock">

Before you delete a source, make sure there are no active destinations enabled for it.
