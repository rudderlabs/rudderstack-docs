## RudderStack Contributor Agreement

To contribute to this project, we would need you to sign the [**Contributor License Agreement (“CLA”)**](https://rudderlabs.wufoo.com/forms/rudderlabs-contributor-license-agreement) for the first commit you make. By agreeing to the [**CLA**](https://rudderlabs.wufoo.com/forms/rudderlabs-contributor-license-agreement),
we can add you to list of approved contributors and review the changes proposed by you.

## Contributing to the docs

The RudderStack documentation is open source. This means that if you come across any issues or bugs or have any suggestions for improvement, you can navigate to the specific file in our [**docs repo**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudderstack-docs), make the change, and raise a PR.

For instance, to create a PR for contributing to docs for a new third-party integration, follow these instructions on [**submitting an integration PR**](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/user-guides/how-to-guides/how-to-submit-an-integration-pull-request/).

You can also [**submit an issue**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server/issues/new), give some context around it, and we will look into the issue immediately.

## Committing

We prefer squash or rebase commits so that all changes from a branch are committed to master as a single commit. All pull requests are squashed when merged, but rebasing prior to merge gives you better control over the commit message.

## Installing and setting up RudderStack

To contribute to the docs, you may need to install RudderStack on your machine. You can do so by following our [**docs**](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/data-plane-setup/) and set up RudderStack in no time.

## Getting help

For any questions, concerns, or queries, you can start by asking a question in our [**Slack**](https://rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack-community/) community.

### We look forward to your feedback on improving this project!
