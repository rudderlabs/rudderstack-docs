# Databricks Delta Lake

[Delta Lake](https://databricks.com/product/delta-lake-on-databricks) is a popular data lake used for both streaming and batch operations. It lets you store structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data securely and reliably. With features such as support for ACID transactions, scalable metadata management, and schema enforcement, Delta Lake enables you to scale and deliver real-time data insights and analytics directly via your data lake.

RudderStack lets you configure Delta Lake as a destination to which you can send your event data seamlessly.

## Configuring Delta Lake destination in RudderStack

<div class="infoBlock">

Before configuring Delta Lake as a destination in RudderStack, it is highly recommended to go through the following sections to obtain the necessary configuration settings. These sections also contain the steps to grant RudderStack and Databricks the necessary permissions to your preferred storage bucket.

<li><a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/data-warehouse-integrations/delta-lake/#obtaining-the-jdbcodbc-configuration">Obtaining the JDBC/ODBC configuration</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

To send event data to Delta Lake, you first need to add it as a destination in RudderStack and connect it to your data source. Once the destination is enabled, events will automatically start flowing to Delta Lake via RudderStack.

To configure Delta Lake as a destination in RudderStack, follow these steps:

1. In your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com), set up the data source. Then, select **Databricks Delta Lake** from the list of destinations.
2. Assign a name to your destination and then click on **Next**.

### Connection settings

<img src="../assets/dw-integrations/delta-lake-connection-settings-2.png" alt="Delta Lake destination settings in RudderStack" />

Enter the following credentials in the **Connection Credentials** page:

* **Host**: Enter your server hostname from the Databricks dashboard. 

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on where to find the server hostname, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/data-warehouse-integrations/delta-lake/#obtaining-the-jdbcodbc-configuration">Obtaining the JDBC/ODBC configuration</a> section below.
</div>

* **Port**: Enter the port number. 

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on obtaining the port number, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/data-warehouse-integrations/delta-lake/#obtaining-the-jdbcodbc-configuration">Obtaining the JDBC/ODBC configuration</a> section below.
</div>

* **HTTP Path**: Enter the cluster's HTTP path.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on obtaining the HTTP path, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/data-warehouse-integrations/delta-lake/#obtaining-the-jdbcodbc-configuration">Obtaining the JDBC/ODBC configuration</a> section below.
</div>

* **Personal Access Token**: Enter your Databricks access token.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on generating the access token, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/data-warehouse-integrations/delta-lake/#generating-the-databricks-access-token">Generating the Databricks access token</a> section below.
</div>

* **Enable delta tables creation in an external location**: Disabled by default, Rudderstack creates delta tables at a default storage location for non-external Hive tables.
  When enabled, it lets you specify the external location to create delta tables: 

<img  src="../assets/dw-integrations/delta-lake-connection-settings-13.png" alt="Delta Lake destination settings in RudderStack"/>

    The delta tables can further be accessed at `{externalLocation}/{schema}/{table}`.

  <div class="infoBlock">

   Note that creating delta tables in an external location is a beta feature currently.<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Stability-Beta-blueviolet" alt="Github Badge" class="githubBadge" />
  </div>

* **Namespace**: Enter the the name of the schema where RudderStack will create the tables. If you don't specify a namespace in the dashboard settings, RudderStack will set it to the source name, by default.
* **Sync Frequency**: Specify how often RudderStack should sync the data to your Delta Lake instance.
* **Sync Starting At**: This optional setting lets you specify the particular time of the day (in UTC) when you want RudderStack to sync the data to the Delta Lake instance.
* **Exclude Window**: This optional setting lets you specify the time window (in UTC) when RudderStack will **skip** the data sync.
* **Object Storage Configuration**: RudderStack currently supports the following platforms for storing the staging files:
    * **Amazon S3**
    * **Google Cloud Storage**
    * **Azure Blob Storage**

<div class="infoBlock">

If you select S3 as your storage provider, RudderStack gives you the option to specify the AWS access key and secret access key in the dashboard itself, to grant Databricks access to your staging bucket. To do so, enable the <strong>Use STS Tokens to copy staging files</strong> setting in the dashboard. For more information, refer to the <a href="#case-2-use-sts-token-to-copy-staging-files-is-enabled-in-the-dashboard">Amazon S3 storage bucket settings</a> section below.
</div>

## Granting RudderStack access to your storage bucket

This section contains the steps to edit your bucket policy to grant RudderStack the necessary permissions, depending on your preferred cloud platform.

### Amazon S3

Follow these steps to grant RudderStack access to your S3 bucket based on the following two cases:

#### Case 1: Use STS Token to copy staging files is disabled in the dashboard

<div class="warningBlock">

Follow the steps listed in this section if the <strong>Use STS Token to copy staging files</strong> option is disabled, i.e. you <strong>don't want to specify</strong> the AWS access key and secret access key while configuring your Delta Lake destination.
</div>

#### For RudderStack Cloud

If you are using RudderStack Cloud, edit your bucket policy using the following JSON:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
      "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::422074288268:user/s3-copy"
    },
    "Action": [
      "s3:GetObject",
      "s3:PutObject",
      "s3:PutObjectAcl",
      "s3:ListBucket"
    ],
    "Resource": [
      "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*",
      "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME"
    ]
  }]
}
```

<div class="infoBlock">

Make sure you replace <code class="inline-code">YOUR_BUCKET_NAME</code> with the name of your S3 bucket.
</div>

#### For self-hosted RudderStack

If you are  [self-hosting RudderStack](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-open-source/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack/), follow these steps:

1. Create an IAM policy with the following JSON:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "*",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*"
  }]
}
```

2. Then, create an [IAM user with programmatic access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html). Attach the above IAM policy to this user. 

<div class="infoBlock">

Copy the ARN of this newly-created user. This is required in the next step.
</div>

3. Next, edit your bucket policy with the following JSON to allow RudderStack to write to your S3 bucket.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
      "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:user/USER_ARN"
    },
    "Action": [
      "s3:GetObject",
      "s3:PutObject",
      "s3:PutObjectAcl",
      "s3:ListBucket"
    ],
    "Resource": [
      "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*",
      "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME"
    ]
  }]
}
```
<div class="infoBlock">

Make sure you replace <code class="inline-code">USER_ARN</code> with the ARN copied in the previous step. Also, replace <code class="inline-code">ACCOUNT_ID</code> with your AWS account ID and <code class="inline-code">YOUR_BUCKET_NAME</code> with the name of your S3 bucket.
</div>

4. Finally, add the programmatic access credentials to the `env` file present in your RudderStack installation, as shown:

```
RUDDER_AWS_S3_COPY_USER_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<user_access_key>
RUDDER_AWS_S3_COPY_USER_ACCESS_KEY=<user_access_key_secret>
```

#### Case 2: Use STS Token to copy staging files is enabled in the dashboard

<div class="infoBlock">

Follow the steps listed in this section if the <strong>Use STS Token to copy staging files</strong> option is enabled in the dashboard.
</div>

You can provide the configuration directly while setting up the Delta Lake destination in RudderStack, as shown:

<img src="../assets/dw-integrations/delta-lake-connection-settings-3.png" alt="S3 settings in RudderStack dashboard" />

## FAQ

### What are the reserved keys for Delta Lake?

Refer to this [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/bs-cyrl-ba/azure/databricks/sql/language-manual/sql-ref-reserved-words) for a complete list of the reserved keywords.

### How does RudderStack handle the reserved words in a column, table, or schema?

There are some limitations when it comes to using reserved words as a schema, table, or column name. If such words are used in event names, traits or properties, they will be prefixed with a `_` when RudderStack creates tables or columns for them in your schema.

Also, integers are **not** allowed at the start of a schema or table name. Hence, such schema, column, or table names will be prefixed with a `_`. For example, `'25dollarpurchase'` will be changed to `'_25dollarpurchase'`.

### How can I modify an existing table to a partitioned table?

1. Set an exclusion window (using the **Exclude window** connection setting) so that RudderStack does not process anything while performing the below changes.
2. Make the required changes in Rudderstack Warehouse configurations.
3. Run the following queries in the Databricks Cluster/SQL endpoints to:
    - Rename the existing table with `_temp` suffix.
    - Add `event_date` column to the `_temp` table.
    - Backfill the data into original table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE x RENAME TO x_temp;
ALTER TABLE x_temp ADD COLUMN TO event_date DATE;
INSERT INTO x SELECT * FROM x_temp;
```

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack will create the new tables with partition support. Refer to the [Databricks documentation on partitions](https://docs.databricks.com/sql/language-manual/sql-ref-partition.html) for more information.

</div>

### How do I convert an existing unmanaged table at a location to an unmanaged table at a new location? / How do I convert an existing managed table to an unmanaged table at a new location?

1. Set an exclusion window (using the **Exclude window** connection setting) so that RudderStack does not process any data while performing the below changes.
2. Run the following queries in the Databricks Cluster/SQL endpoints to:
   - Create a temporary table using the new location.
   - Drop the temporary table.
   - Drop the original table.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE namespace.x_temp DEEP CLONE namespace.x LOCATION '/path/to/new/location/namespace/x';
// where namespace represents the namespace attached to the destination in RudderStack.
// where x represents the original table created by RudderStack.

DROP TABLE namespace.x_temp;
DROP TABLE namespace.x;
```

3. Enable the **Enable delta tables creation in an external location** setting in Rudderstack dashboard and update the location.
4. Remove the exclusion window and make the required changes in Rudderstack Warehouse configurations.

RudderStack will create the table again during the subsequent data syncs.

<div class="infoBlock">

Refer to the [Databricks documentation on managed and unmanaged tables](https://docs.databricks.com/data/tables.html#managed-and-unmanaged-tables) for more information.
</div>

### How do I convert an existing unmanaged table at a specific location to a managed table?

1. Set an exclusion window (using the **Exclude window** connection setting) so that RudderStack does not process anything while performing the below changes.
2. Run the following queries in the Databricks Cluster/SQL Endpoints to:
    - Create a temporary table.
    - Drop original table.
    - Rename temporary table to original table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS namespace.x_temp DEEP CLONE namespace.x;
// where namespace represents the namespace attached to the destination in RudderStack.
// where x represents the original table created by RudderStack.

DROP TABLE namespace.x;
ALTER TABLE namespace.x_temp RENAME TO namespace.x;
```
3. Remove exclusion window and make sure the **Enable delta tables creation in an external location** setting is disabled in the Rudderstack dashboard.

The table will be created again during the subsequent data syncs.
