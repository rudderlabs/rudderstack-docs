  Step-by-step guide on sending your event data from RudderStack to your configured
  webhook endpoint.
---

Webhooks allow you to send the events generated via the RudderStack SDK to your own backend. It is useful in cases where you want to apply some custom logic on the event payload before sending it to your preferred destination platforms.

Once webhooks are enabled as a destination in your dashboard, RudderStack forwards the SDK events to your configured webhook endpoint.

<div class="infoBlock">
Find the open source transformer code for this destination in the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/v0/destinations/webhook">GitHub repository</a>.
</div>

## Getting started

Before configuring your source and destination in the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), verify if the platform you are working on is supported by the webhook destination by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | -             | -             | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">
To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, read the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack connection modes</a> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that your platform supports sending events to webhooks, perform the steps below:

1. Choose a source to which you would like to add your webhook endpoint as a destination.
2. Select the destination as **Webhook** to your source. Give your destination a name and then click on **Continue**.

### Connection settings

In the **Connection Settings** page, enter the relevant connection information and click on **Next** to complete the destination setup.

<img src="../assets/event-stream-destinations/webhook-connection-settings.png" alt="Webhook connection settings" />

The settings are listed below:

- **Webhook URL**: This is the endpoint where RudderStack sends the events. Both `http` and `https` are supported. For `https`, **TLS cert** needs to be **valid** for a successful event delivery.
- **URL Method**: This is the HTTP method of the request sent to the configured endpoint. Supported methods are `POST`, `PUT` and `GET`. By default, RudderStack uses the `POST` method to send the events.
- **Headers**: Add custom headers for your events via this option. These headers will be added to the request made from RudderStack to your webhook. By default, RudderStack adds the following headers for the `POST` and `PUT` requests:

| Key            | Value              |
| :------------- | :----------------- |
| `User-Agent`   | `RudderLabs`       |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |

<div class="infoBlock">
RudderStack also supports adding a dynamic header for your events through user transformation. For more information, refer to our <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/sample-user-transformers/blob/master/AddDynamicHeader.js">user transformer code</a> in our GitHub repo.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">
You can also add a dynamic path to your base URL. For more information on how to do this, refer to our <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/sample-user-transformers/blob/master/DynamicPathtoBaseURL.js">user transformer code</a> in our GitHub repo.

## Identify

The `identify` call is used to associate a user to their actions. Apart from capturing a unique user ID, you can also send optional traits associated with that user, such as name, email, IP address, etc. using the RudderStack SDKs.

A sample `identify` payload is as shown:

```javascript
{
  "channel": "web",
  "context": {
    "app": {
      "build": "1.0.0",
      "name": "RudderLabs JavaScript SDK",
      "namespace": "com.rudderlabs.javascript",
      "version": "1.1.1-rc.2"
    },
    "traits": {
      "name": "User name",
      "email": "user@domain.com",
      "plan": "Enterprise",
      "company": { "id": "company-A" },
      "createdAt": "Thu Mar 24 2016 17:46:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)"
    },
    "library": { "name": "RudderLabs JavaScript SDK", "version": "1.1.1-rc.2" },
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.3987.149 Safari/537.36",
    "locale": "en-US",
    "os": { "name": "", "version": "" },
    "screen": { "density": 1.600000023841858 },
    "page": {
      "path": "/tests/html/script-test.html",
      "referrer": "http://localhost:1111/tests/html/",
      "search": "",
      "title": "",
      "url": "http://localhost:1111/tests/html/script-test.html"
    }
  },
  "type": "identify",
  "messageId": "508d5e8c-96e4-4301-bd46-1890dba5c866",
  "originalTimestamp": "2020-04-22T08:06:20.337Z",
  "anonymousId": "21b43de4-3b9b-423f-b51f-794eae31fc03",
  "userId": "my-user-id",
  "integrations": { "All": true },
  "sentAt": "2020-04-22T08:06:20.337Z"
}
```

For each `identify` call, RudderStack sends the request in the following manner \(depending on the URL method configured in the dashboard\):

- **`POST`**: RudderStack sends the whole event payload \(as shown above\) as the JSON body of the `POST` request.
- **`PUT`**: RudderStack sends the whole event payload \(as shown above\) as the JSON body of the `PUT` request.
- **`GET`**: RudderStack sends the traits passed in the `identify` call as the query parameters of the `GET` request. If your traits contain nested values, RudderStack flattens these values and sends them as the query parameters. For example, the company ID specified in the above payload's `traits` is sent as `"company.id": "company-A"`.

## Page

The `page` call lets you record your website's page views, with any additional relevant information about the viewed page. For more information on the `page` call, refer to the [**RudderStack API Specification**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/) guide.

A sample `page` payload is as shown:

```javascript
{
  "channel": "web",
  "context": {
    "app": {
      "build": "1.0.0",
      "name": "RudderLabs JavaScript SDK",
      "namespace": "com.rudderlabs.javascript",
      "version": "1.1.1-rc.2"
    },
    "traits": {},
    "library": { "name": "RudderLabs JavaScript SDK", "version": "1.1.1-rc.2" },
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/80.0.3987.149 Safari/537.36",
    "locale": "en-US",
    "os": { "name": "", "version": "" },
    "screen": { "density": 1.600000023841858 },
    "page": {
      "path": "/tests/html/script-test.html",
      "referrer": "http://localhost:1111/tests/html/",
      "search": "",
      "title": "",
      "url": "http://localhost:1111/tests/html/script-test.html"
    }
  },
  "type": "page",
  "messageId": "97114191-e2f2-42af-97db-14b358b1cfe1",
  "originalTimestamp": "2020-04-22T08:06:20.334Z",
  "anonymousId": "57d95a96-61dc-47bf-8f96-5d37543d7438",
  "userId": "user@domain.com",
  "properties": {
    "path": "/tests/html/script-test.html",
    "referrer": "http://localhost:1111/tests/html/",
    "search": "",
    "title": "",
    "url": "http://localhost:1111/tests/html/script-test.html",
    "experiment": {"variant": "old"}
  },
  "integrations": { "All": true },
  "sentAt": "2020-04-22T08:06:20.334Z"
}
```

For each `page` call, RudderStack sends the request in the following manner\(depending on the URL method configured in the dashboard\):

- **`POST`:** RudderStack sends the whole event payload \(as shown above\) as the JSON body of the `POST` request.
- **`PUT`:** RudderStack sends the whole event payload \(as shown above\) as the JSON body of the `PUT` request.
- **`GET`:** RudderStack sends the properties passed in the `page` call as query parameters of the `GET` request. If your properties contain nested values, RudderStack flattens these values and sends them as query parameters. For example, the experiment variant specified in the above payload's properties is sent as `"experiment.variant": "old"`.

## Track

The `track` call captures all the activities that the user performs, along with any other properties that are associated with those activities. Each of these activities or actions is considered as an **event**. For more information on the `track` call, refer to the [**RudderStack API Specification**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/) guide.

A sample `track` payload is as shown:

```javascript
{
  "channel": "web",
  "context": {
    "app": {
      "build": "1.0.0",
      "name": "RudderLabs JavaScript SDK",
      "namespace": "com.rudderlabs.javascript",
      "version": "1.1.1-rc.2"
    },
    "traits": {
      "name": "User name",

  "sentAt": "2020-04-22T08:06:20.338Z"
}
```

To view the other events and detailed event structure for the types of events being sent, check out the [**RudderStack API Specification**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/).

For each `track` call, RudderStack sends the request in the following manner\(depending on the URL method configured in the dashboard\):

- **`POST`:** RudderStack sends the whole event payload \(as shown above\) as the JSON body of the `POST` request.
- **`PUT`:** RudderStack sends the whole event payload \(as shown above\) as the JSON body of the `PUT` request.
- **`GET`:** RudderStack sends the properties that you pass in the `track` call as query parameters of the `GET` request. If your properties contain nested values, RudderStack will flatten these values before sending them.

## Dynamic header support

In the settings config, you can set static headers for the webhook call. However, in some cases you may want to dynamically change or add a header to the webhook. This can be done through a top-level object with a key of `header`. This top-level key can be added using a [user transformation](https://rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/) and the following line of code `event.header = { "Authorization": "some-auth" }`. Below is an example of a payload with this feature.

```javascript
{
  event: "some-event-name",
  type: "track",
  properties: {
    color: "blue",
    number: 3,
    newMember: true
  },
  header: {
    "Authorization": "Bearer 3841718412jhcdskc"
  }
}
```

## Dynamically appending to the endpoint URL

In the settings config, you will enter the endpoint that this webhook will be pointed to. There are some use-cases where depending on the event that is going to this destination, the endpoint may need to be changed. RudderStack allows you to append a dynamic string to your webhook endpoint using a top-level key named `appendPath`. This top-level key can be added using a [user transformation](https://rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/) and the following line of code `event.appendPath = 'some-path'`.

```javascript
Fixed Endpoint URL From Settings
--------------------------------
endpoint: 'https://www.google.com/'

Dynamically Append String to Endpoint
-------------------------------------
appendPath: 'search?q=cats'

Final Endpoint
--------------
endpoint: 'https://www.google.com/search?q=cats'
```

## FAQ

### How do I check if there are any event delivery failures?

1. Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com).
2. Verify that you are sending the events in the **Live Events** tab of your source.
3. Check if there are any delivery failures in the **Live Events** tab of your destination. An example of an event failure is as shown:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59817155/125619804-64033117-16f6-44c7-8050-286059ab404d.png" />

4. You can then check the **Error Response** to get more details about the error, including the reason of the failure, as shown:

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59817155/125619922-c68b1c48-50aa-4ce9-8803-8381170e3cc9.png" />
