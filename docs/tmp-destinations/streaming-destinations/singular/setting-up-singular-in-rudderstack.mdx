Before configuring Singular as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Singular by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server** |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :--------- |
| **Device mode**     | -             | **Supported** | -          |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported**            | **Supported**             | **Supported**        |

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Singular, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Singular**.
2. Assign a name to your destination and click on **Continue**.
