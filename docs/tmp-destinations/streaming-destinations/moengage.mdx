## Getting started

Before configuring your source and destination on the RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by MoEngage, by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device Mode**     | **Supported** | **Supported** | **-**         |
| **Cloud Mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">
To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <Link to="/tmp-destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</Link> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the platform supports sending events to MoEngage, perform the steps below:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderlabs.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **MoEngage**.
2. Assign a name to the destination and click on **Continue**. You should then see the following screen:

## Identify

To identify a user to MoEngage, you need to call the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify">`identify`</Link> API.

MoEngage needs a unique identifier to identify a user. So, if you provide `userId` in your `identify` call, RudderStack passes it as that `customer_id` . Otherwise, it sends an `anonymousId` if a `userId` is not present.

You can also create a new user property or update existing user properties of the users using the `identify` API.

A sample identify call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("name123", {
  name: "Name Surname",
  first_name: "Name",
  last_name: "Surname",
  email: "name@surname.com",
  createdAt: "Thu Mar 24 2020 17:46:45 GMT+0000 (UTC)",
})
```

<div class="infoBlock">

Identify api will be used to **Login** the user into MoEngage in **Device** Mode

</div>

### MoEngage Reserved Properties

The following property names are reserved by MoEngage:

- `name`
- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `email`
- `age`
- `gender`
- `mobile`
- `transactions`
- `revenue`
- `moe_unsubscribe`

<div class="warningBlock">

You may create custom properties but you should not create properties with the following names `"`**`id`**`"`, `"`**`_id`**`"`, or `""` .

</div>

### Identifying a Device to MoEngage

You can also identify a device to MoEngage , using the `identify` API. With this API, you can create new properties or update the existing properties of the device.

A sample call for identifying device is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("name123", {
  context: {
    device: {
      id: "7ase32188a4dab669f",
      manufacturer: "Apple",
      model: "IOS SDK built for x86",
      name: "generic_x86",
      token: "devtoken",
      type: "ios",
    },
  },
})
```

## Track

To track your users' actions, you can use the RudderStack <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track">`track`</Link> API. You can call `track` with `eventname` and the associated properties.

A sample `track` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Order Completed", {
  checkout_id: "C324532",
  order_id: "T1230",
  value: 15.98,
  revenue: 16.98,
  shipping: 3.0,
  coupon: "FY21",
  currency: "INR",
  products: [
    {
      product_id: "product-mixedfruit-jam",
      sku: "sku-1",
      category: "Food",
      name: "Food/Drink",
      brand: "Sample",
      variant: "None",
      price: 10.0,
      quantity: 2,
      currency: "INR",
      position: 1,
      value: 6.0,
      typeOfProduct: "Food",
      url: "https://www.example.com/product/bacon-jam",
      image_url: "https://www.example.com/product/bacon-jam.jpg",
    },
  ],
})
```

## Alias

The Alias api is used to merge two different profiles of a same user into a single profile.

Alias call can be done only through mobile sdks.

## Configuring Push Notifications

<!--{% tabs %}
{% tab title="iOS" %}

- To send push notifications in iOS an APNS certificate needs to be created and has to be converted to `.pem` file.
- This `.pem` file needs to be uploaded in the MoEngage dashboard.
- In the target app turn on App Groups and enable one of the App group ids, in case if you don't have an App Group ID then create one. The name of your app group should be `group.{bundle id}.MoEngage`.
- Turn on Background mode and set/enable Remote Notification.
- Turn on push notification capabilities in your app.
- Before initializing add `[MoEngage setAppGroupID:<your app group id>];`
- In case if you would like to keep the notifications even after the App Launch then : `[MoEngage sharedInstance].disableBadgeReset = true;`

<div class="infoBlock">

For more detailed steps follow [MoEngage guidelines here](https://docs.moengage.com/docs/push-notification-implementation).

</div>

### In-App messaging

In-app messaging is a type of mobile messaging where the notification is displayed within the app. Some examples include popups, yes/no prompts, interstitials, and more. To implement this follow this guide: [**InApp NATIV**](https://docs.moengage.com/docs/in-app-nativ)**.**
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Android" %}
Copy the Server Key from the FCM console and add it to the MoEngage Dashboard\(Not sure where to find the Server Key refer to [Getting FCM Server Key](https://docs.moengage.com/docs/getting-fcmgcm-server-key). To upload it, go to the [Settings Page](https://app.moengage.com/v3/#/settings/push/mobile) and add the Server Key and package name.
**Please make sure you add the keys both in the Test and Live environment.**

Before configuring MoEngage SDK for receiving push notifications make you have configured Firebase in your application, if not done already refer to the [documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) and complete setup.
Also, make sure you have added the Firebase Messaging dependency in your application `build.gradle` file.

### Adding meta for push notification

To show push notifications you need to add the notification small icon and large icon along with the AppId to the `MoEngage.Builder`

```kotlin
val moEngage = MoEngage.Builder(this, "XXXXXXXX")
        .setNotificationSmallIcon(R.drawable.icon)
        .setNotificationLargeIcon(R.drawable.ic_launcher)
        .build()
MoEngage.initialise(moEngage)
```

For showing Push notifications there are 2 important things

1. Registration for Push, i.e. generating push token.
2. Receiving the Push payload from Firebase Cloud Messaging\(FCM\) service and showing the notification on the device. The above can either be handled by the application or MoEngage SDK. There is some configuration required based on whether the above-mentioned things are handled by the application or SDK.

### Push Registration and Receiving handled by App

By default, MoEngage SDK attempts to register for push token, since your application is handling push you need to opt-out of SDK's token registration.

#### How to opt-out of MoEngage Registration?

To opt-out of MoEngage's token registration mechanism call in the `optOutTokenRegistration()` on the `MoEngage.Builder` as shown below

```kotlin
val moEngage = MoEngage.Builder(this, "XXXXXXXX")
        .setNotificationSmallIcon(R.drawable.icon)
        .setNotificationLargeIcon(R.drawable.ic_launcher)
        .configureFcm(FcmConfig(false))
        .build()
MoEngage.initialise(moEngage)
```

#### Pass the Push Token To MoEngage SDK

The Application would need to pass the Push Token received from FCM to the MoEngage SDK for the MoEngage platform to send out push notifications to the device. Use the below API to pass the push token to the MoEngage SDK.

```kotlin
MoEFireBaseHelper.getInstance().passPushToken(applicationContext, token)
```

_Note:_ Please make sure token is passed to MoEngage SDK whenever push token is refreshed and on application update. Passing token on application update is important for migration to the MoEngage Platform.

#### Passing the Push payload to the MoEngage SDK

To pass the push payload to the MoEngage SDK call the MoEngage API from the `onMessageReceived()` from the Firebase receiver.
Before passing the payload to the MoEngage SDK you should check if the payload is from the MoEngage platform using the helper API provided by the SDK.

```java
if (MoEPushHelper.getInstance().isFromMoEngagePlatform(remoteMessage.data)) {
  MoEFireBaseHelper.getInstance().passPushPayload(
    applicationContext,
    remoteMessage.data
  )
} else {
  // your app's business logic to show notification
}
```

### Push Registration and Receiving handled by SDK

Add the below code in your manifest file within the application tag

```markup
<service android:name="com.moengage.firebase.MoEFireBaseMessagingService">
  <intent-filter>
    <action android:name="com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT" />
  </intent-filter>
</service>
```

When MoEngage SDK handles push registration it optionally provides a callback to the Application whenever a new token is registered or token is refreshed.
An application can get this callback by implementing `FirebaseEventListener` and registering for a callback in the Application class' `onCreate()`using `MoEFireBaseHelper.getInstance().setEventListener()`

### In-App messaging:

In-app messaging is a type of mobile messaging where the notification is displayed within the app. Examples include popups, yes/no prompts, interstitials, and more. To implement this follow: [ **InApp NATIV**](https://docs.moengage.com/docs/configuring-in-app-nativ)

      <TabPanel>
        <ol>
         <li>To send push notifications in iOS, an APNS certificate needs to be created and converted to a <code class="inline-code">.pem</code> file. This <code class="inline-code">.pem</code> file needs to be uploaded in the MoEngage dashboard.</li>
         <li>Enable <strong>Background mode</strong> by navigating to <strong>Targets</strong> > <strong>Select Your App</strong> > <strong>Signing & Capabilities</strong> > <strong>Select Background Modes</strong>. Then, check <strong>Remote notifications</strong>.</li>
          <li>Then, in your <code class="inline-code">plist</code> file, add the <code class="inline-code">MoEngageAppDelegateProxyEnabled</code> key and set it to <code class="inline-code">false</code> to disable swizzling.</li>
          <li>Finally, implement the relevant methods in your <code class="inline-code">AppDelegate</code> file by referring to <Link to="/sources/sdks/rudderstack-ios-sdk/ios-v2/#supporting-push-notifications-for-device-mode-destinations">this section</Link>.</li>
         <li>To keep the push notifications even after app launch, you can call the below method:
<span>

```swift
MoEngage.sharedInstance().setDisableBadgeReset(true)
```
</span>

<span>

```objectivec
[[MoEngage sharedInstance] setDisableBadgeReset:true];
```
</span>
</li>

Copy the Server Key from the FCM console and add it to the MoEngage Dashboard(Not sure where to find the Server Key refer to <a href="https://docs.moengage.com/docs/getting-fcmgcm-server-key">Getting FCM Server Key</a>. To upload it, go to the <a href="https://app.moengage.com/v3/#/settings/push/mobile">Settings Page</a> and add the Server Key and package name.
**Please make sure you add the keys both in the Test and Live environment.**
Before configuring MoEngage SDK for receiving push notifications make you have configured Firebase in your application, if not done already refer to the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup">documentation</a> and complete setup.
Also, make sure you have added the Firebase Messaging dependency in your application <code class="inline-code">build.gradle</code> file.
<h3>Adding meta for push notification</h3>
To show push notifications you need to add the notification small icon and large icon along with the AppId to the <code class="inline-code">MoEngage.Builder</code>
<span>

```kotlin
val moEngage = MoEngage.Builder(this, "XXXXXXXX")
        .setNotificationSmallIcon(R.drawable.icon)
        .setNotificationLargeIcon(R.drawable.ic_launcher)
        .build()
MoEngage.initialise(moEngage)
```
</span>
For showing Push notifications there are 2 important things
<ol>
<li> Registration for Push, i.e. generating push token.</li>
<li> Receiving the Push payload from Firebase Cloud Messaging(FCM) service and showing the notification on the device. The above can either be handled by the application or MoEngage SDK. There is some configuration required based on whether the above-mentioned things are handled by the application or SDK.
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Push Registration and Receiving handled by App</h3>

By default, MoEngage SDK attempts to register for push token, since your application is handling push you need to opt-out of SDK's token registration.

<h4>How to opt-out of MoEngage Registration?</h4>

To opt-out of MoEngage's token registration mechanism call in the <code class="inline-code">optOutTokenRegistration()</code> on the <code class="inline-code">MoEngage.Builder</code> as shown below
<span>

```kotlin
val moEngage = MoEngage.Builder(this, "XXXXXXXX")
        .setNotificationSmallIcon(R.drawable.icon)
        .setNotificationLargeIcon(R.drawable.ic_launcher)
        .configureFcm(FcmConfig(false))
        .build()
MoEngage.initialise(moEngage)
```
</span>
<h4>Pass the Push Token To MoEngage SDK</h4>
The Application would need to pass the Push Token received from FCM to the MoEngage SDK for the MoEngage platform to send out push notifications to the device. Use the below API to pass the push token to the MoEngage SDK.
<span>

```java
MoEFireBaseHelper.getInstance().passPushToken(applicationContext, token)
```
</span>
_Note:_ Please make sure token is passed to MoEngage SDK whenever push token is refreshed and on application update. Passing token on application update is important for migration to the MoEngage Platform.
<h4>Passing the Push payload to the MoEngage SDK</h4>
To pass the push payload to the MoEngage SDK call the MoEngage API from the `onMessageReceived()` from the Firebase receiver.
Before passing the payload to the MoEngage SDK you should check if the payload is from the MoEngage platform using the helper API provided by the SDK.
<span>

```java
if (MoEPushHelper.getInstance().isFromMoEngagePlatform(remoteMessage.data)) {
  MoEFireBaseHelper.getInstance().passPushPayload(
    applicationContext,
    remoteMessage.data
  )
} else {
  // your app's business logic to show notification
}
```
</span>
<h4>Push Registration and Receiving handled by SDK</h4>
Add the below code in your manifest file within the application tag
<span>

```markup
<service android:name="com.moengage.firebase.MoEFireBaseMessagingService">
  <intent-filter>
    <action android:name="com.google.firebase.MESSAGING_EVENT" />
  </intent-filter>
</service>
```
</span>
When MoEngage SDK handles push registration it optionally provides a callback to the Application whenever a new token is registered or token is refreshed.
An application can get this callback by implementing <code class="inline-code">FirebaseEventListener</code> and registering for a callback in the Application class' <code class="inline-code">onCreate()</code>using <code class="inline-code">MoEFireBaseHelper.getInstance().setEventListener()</code>

## Debugging in Web SDK

From the RudderStack [dashboard](htps://app.rudderstack.com), turn on the debug mode to get debug logs. The events will be seen under the **Test** section of the particular app in MoEngage.

## Timezone offset for cloud mode

### Track

MoEngage allows sending the t[ime at which the event occurred](https://docs.moengage.com/docs/data-import-apis#event-api) and calculates the user local time by taking two parameters. `current_time` and `user_timezone_offset` where the `current_time` is **UTC** Time at which the event happened, and `user_timezone_offset` is the difference in seconds between the **user local time and UTC.**

<div class="infoBlock">

The RudderStack transformer maps the _**current_time** to **timestamp or originalTimestamp**_
value from the event payload sent to Rudder server. This value should be passed in **UTC.**

</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

The _**user_timezone_offset**_ is mapped to _**timezone**_ field present under the _**context**_ object of the event payload. This value should be passed as **tz** string.
Rudder mobile SDKs populate the timezone field by itself. But for other sources like server like SDKs, HTTP api, the timezone needs to be set explicitly in every request.

</div>

Example payload:

```javascript
{
  "type": "track",
  "event": "Email Replied",
  "sentAt": "2020-12-02T11:30:33.262Z",
  "context": {
    "library": {
      "name": "analytics-node",
      "version": "0.0.3"
    },
    "timezone": "Asia/Kolkata"
  },
  "rudderId": "87a40cf3-f6d8-4675-bc01-7854ab4486ec",
  "_metadata": {
    "nodeVersion": "10.22.0"
  },
  "messageId": "node-7519b5f2fcacca521c7a9e8ddb9fc09c-c273004b-6968-422d-a511-440b6db24403",
  "properties": {
    "details": "list of details"
  },
  "anonymousId": "anony11111111111",
  "originalTimestamp": "2020-12-02T11:30:33.259Z"
}
```

### Identify

MoEngage accepts user creation time for its [user endpoint](https://docs.moengage.com/docs/data-import-apis#user-api). This is reflected as `first_Seen` in their dashboard.

<div class="infoBlock">

The RudderStack transformer maps the _**created_time**_ from the _**createdAt**_ spec'd traits in our payload. The value should be in the **ISO 8601** format.
If the value is not in proper format or not present, MoEngage will put in the value by itself.

</div>

An example payload is as shown:

```javascript
{
  "type": "identify",
  "sentAt": "2020-12-02T13:04:05.953Z",
  "traits": {
    "city": "Bangalore",
    "name": "lolo",
    "email": "lolo@website.com",
    "country": "India",
    "createdAt": "2020-12-02T12:29:53.872Z"
  },
  "userId": "111its111",
  "context": {
    "traits": {
      "city": "Bangalore",
      "name": "lolo",
      "email": "lolo@website.com",
      "country": "India",
      "createdAt": "2020-12-02T12:29:53.872Z"
    },
    "library": {
      "name": "analytics-node",
      "version": "0.0.3"
    }
  },
  "rudderId": "754fe90e-89fb-4d71-9d11-3ec2b91b5777",
  "_metadata": {
    "nodeVersion": "10.22.0"
  },
  "messageId": "node-1a585828272cf1116407aaf6be3921f2-65c1670e-f4e1-4283-a7a5-0a60825c4f83",
  "originalTimestamp": "2020-12-02T13:04:05.951Z"
}
```
