RudderStack lets you send your event data to DCM Floodlight destination via the <Link to="/tmp-destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">device mode</Link> using the native web SDK. RudderStack uses global site tagging in device mode.

## Track

The <Link to="/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/track">`track`</Link> call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.

A sample `track` call is as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track('tshirt', {
  countingMethod: "transactions",
  revenue: "2605846",
  orderId: "2605847"
});
```
The `countingMethod` is a required property that specifies how to count the conversions for a Floodlight activity. The methods to count conversions depend on whether you  are creating or editing a [counter](https://support.google.com/campaignmanager/answer/7554821#zippy=%2Cfields-in-event-snippets-for-counter-tags) or [sales](https://support.google.com/campaignmanager/answer/7554821#zippy=%2Cfields-in-event-snippets-for-sales-tags) tag activity. Refer to the <Link to="#faq">FAQ</Link> section for more information on counting methods for these tags.
