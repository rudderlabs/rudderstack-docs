## Getting Started

To enable sending data to Google Analytics 360, you will first need to add it as a destination in the RudderStack dashboard. Once the destination is configured and enabled, events from RudderStack will start flowing to Google Analytics 360.

| **Device Mode**     | **Supported** | -             | -             |

## FAQs

### Can I anonymize an IP Address in Google Analytics 360?

Yes, you can. Turn on the **Anonymize IP Addresses** setting under the **Other Settings** option in the RudderStack dashboard while configuring Google Analytics 360.

This setting lets Google Analytics anonymize the address at the earliest possible stage of the data collection.
