RudderStack helps you integrate your website with Quantum Metric to auto-track all your user data.

## Getting started

Before configuring Quantum Metric as a destination in RudderStack, make sure that the source platform is supported by Quantum Metric by referring to the following table:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Device mode** | **Supported** | - | - |
| **Cloud mode** | - | - | - |

To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <Link to="/tmp-destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</Link> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that Quantum Metric supports the source type, follow these steps:

* From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderlabs.com/), add the source. Then, select **Quantum Metric** from the list of destinations.
* Assign a name to your destination, and then click on **Next**. You should then see the following screen:

### Connection Settings

The following settings need to be configured to successfully set up Quantum Metric as a destination in RudderStack:

* **Site ID**: Enter your site ID here.

<div class="successBlock">

Your can get the Site ID by logging into your [**IAM Quantum Metric dashboard**](https://iam.quantummetric.com/). There, select the **Account** button in the top-right corner. Then, click on **Install** and inspect the installation tag. Your site ID will be found in the following line:

```javascript
qtm.src = 'https://cdn.quantummetric.com/qscripts/quantum-<SITE_ID>.js';
```
</div>

* Finally, click on **Next** to complete the configuration. Quantum Metric will now be added and enabled as a device-mode destination in RudderStack.

<div class="infoBlock">

As this is a web device mode-only integration, the **Use native SDK to send events** option cannot be disabled. For more information on the web device mode, refer to the [**RudderStack connection modes**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/) guide.
</div>

## Sending events to Quantum Metric

Quantum Metric auto-tracks your user data. There is **no need** to call any of `identify`, `page` or `track` methods explicitly.
