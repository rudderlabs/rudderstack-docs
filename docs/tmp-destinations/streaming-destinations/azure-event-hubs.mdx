description: Step-by-step guide on sending your event data from RudderStack to Azure Event Hubs. as a destination in RudderStack
---

[**Azure Event Hubs**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/) is a data streaming platform and an event ingestion service. It provides a Kafka endpoint which can be used by your existing Kafka-based applications as an alternative to running your own Kafka clusters.

RudderStack supports Azure Event Hubs as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your event data.

<div class="warningBlock">

**RudderStack does not support the Basic tier of Azure Event Hubs**. For this integration to work, you need to have a standard tier \(or higher\) of Event Hubs which includes an Apache Kafka endpoint.  
  
For more information, refer to the Event Hubs' [**pricing page**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/event-hubs/#pricing).

## Getting started

To enable sending data to Azure Event Hubs, you need to add it as a destination in RudderStack. Once the destination is enabled, events from RudderStack will start to flow to Azure Event Hubs. 

Before configuring your source and destination in [**RudderStack**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), check whether the source platform is supported by Azure Event Hubs by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Device Mode** | - | - | - |
| **Cloud Mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">
To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <Link to="/tmp-destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</Link> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the platform supports sending events to Azure Event Hubs, perform the steps as mentioned below:

* Choose a source to which you would like to add Azure Event Hubs as a destination.
* Select the destination as **Azure Event Hubs**. Give your destination a name, and then click on **Next**.
* In the **Connection Settings**, ****fill the required fields with the relevant information and click **Next.**

### Connection Settings

This section lists the required connection settings to configure Event Hubs as a destination in RudderStack.

* **Bootstrap server**: The bootstrap server information goes here. This is in the format`hostname of your event hub namespace`:`port`
* **Topic Name**: The topic name, or the name of the Event Hub that you have created in your [**Azure portal**](https://portal.azure.com). 
* **Event Hubs Connection String**: Your Event Hubs' primary connection string. For more information, refer to Microsoft's [**How to get Event hubs connection string**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-get-connection-string) guide. 

## Partition Key

RudderStack uses `userId` as the partition key of a given message. 

<div class="infoBlock">

If the `userId` is not present in the payload, then `anonymousId` is used.
</div>

If you have a multi-partitioned topic, then the records of the same `userId` \(or `anonymousId` in absence of `userId`\) will always go to the same partition.

## FAQs

#### **What is my Bootstrap server address?**

The Bootstrap server address is in the following format:

`hostname of Event Hub namespace`: `port`

For example:  `NAMESPACENAME.servicebus.windows.net:9093` 

Here `NAMESPACENAME` is your event hubs namespace, while `9093` is the port number.

#### **Where can I get the Topic name?**

The Topic name is the name of the **Event Hub** that you have created in your [**Azure portal**](https://portal.azure.com).

#### **Where can I get the Event Hubs connection string?**

Event Hubs connection string is the primary connection string of your shared access policy. For more information, refer to Microsoft's [**How to get Event hubs connection string**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-get-connection-string) guide. 

#### **Why am I getting the "The client is not authorized to access this topic" error?**

Check whether you are using the proper Event Hubs connection string for the policy that you have created. 

You need to create a policy to write to the Event Hub with a `Send` permission, and put the corresponding primary connection string in the destination settings, as described in the [**Getting Started**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/data-ingestion/azure-event-hubs#getting-started) section of this guide.
