[Attribution](https://attributionapp.com) is a marketing analytics platform that provides single and multi-touch attribution. It offers the ability to view your true marketing ROI, understand your marketing funnel and view your full customer paths. Additionally, Attribution offers a [Data Export](https://www.attributionapp.com/dataexporttool/) feature to let you export all the raw data related to campaigns and visitors for your Data Science team to analyze and unlock trends.

RudderStack supports Attribution as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your customer data.

## Getting started

Before configuring Attribution as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Attribution by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device Mode**     | -         | -         | -         |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">

To learn more about the difference between the cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <Link to="/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</Link> guide.

</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Attribution, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Attribution**.
2. Assign a name to the destination and click on **Continue**.
3. Select the data source and click on **Next**.
4. Enter your Attribution Project key to configure the destination.

Your Attribution destination is now configured and enabled in RudderStack.

## Identify

The <Link to="/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/identify">`identify`</Link> call lets you associate a visiting user to their actions. It also lets you record the traits about them like their name, email address, etc.

<div class="infoBlock">

As a best practice, make sure that the `identify` call is made at the start of every session or page load for logged-in users. This will ensure all the latest user traits are captured.

</div>

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("userid", {
  name: "Alex Keener",
  email: "alex@example.com",
  phone: "+1-202-555-0146",
  birthday: "01/24/1982",
  gender: "Male",
  avatar: "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/alex",
  title: "Mr",
})
```




## Track

The <Link to="/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/track">`track`</Link> call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.

A sample `track` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Order Completed", {
  revenue: 77.6,
})
```

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the `track` call, refer to the <Link to="/rudderstack-api/http-api">RudderStack HTTP API Specification</Link>.

</div>

## Page

The <Link to="/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/page">`page`</Link> call lets you record your website's page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.

A sample `page` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page("Cart", "Cart Viewed", {
  path: "/cart",
  referrer: "test.com",
  search: "term",
  title: "test_item",
  url: "http://test.in",
})
```

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the `page` call, refer to the <Link to="/rudderstack-api/http-api">RudderStack HTTP API Specification</Link>.

</div>

## Group

The <Link to="/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/group">`group`</Link> call lets you link an identified user with a group such as a company, organization, or an account. It also lets you record any custom traits associated with that group like the name of the company, number of employees, etc.

A sample `group` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.group("sample-group-id", {
  name: "Example Company",
  employees: 1000,
  industry: "Software",
});
```

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the <code class="inline-code">group</code> call, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/http-api">RudderStack HTTP API Specification</a> guide.

</div>

## Alias

The <Link to="/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/alias">`alias`</Link> call lets you merge different identities of a known user.

A sample `alias` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.alias("to", "from", options, callback)
```

The above `alias` call has the following parameters:

| **Parameter**  | **Presence** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :------------- | :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`to`**       | Required     | Denotes the new identifier                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **`from`**     | Optional     | Denotes the old identifier which will be an alias for the `to` parameter. If not provided, the SDK will populate this as the currently identified `userId`, or `anonymousId` in case of anonymous users. |
| **`options`**  | Optional     | This dictionary provides additional context to the event payload.                                                                                                                                        |
| **`callback`** | Optional     | This function gets executed after successful execution of the **`alias()`** method.                                                                                                                      |
