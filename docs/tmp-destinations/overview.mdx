## What is a destination?

A RudderStack destination is the target for your source event data, generally either a *streaming* destination or a *warehouse* destination. 

* **Streaming destinations** consume your event data to complement their offering which may be related to marketing, analytics, CRM, etc.
* **Warehouse destinations** are storage destinations such as Amazon Redshift, Snowflake, or Google BigQuery.

RudderStack currently supports integration with over 150 popular destination platforms such as Google Analytics, Amplitude, Mixpanel, Salesforce, and more. This section provides detailed documentation on setting up these event stream destinations in RudderStack to send your event data in no time.
