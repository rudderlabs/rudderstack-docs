## FAQ

### Do I need to sign up for an account to set up open source RudderStack?

Signing up for [RudderStack Open Source](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup?type=opensource) is the easiest way to set up and manage your data pipelines. The web app is only used for source/destination configuration and does not have access to your data. It also provides a <Link to="/dashboard-guides/live-events/">Live Events</Link> feature for debugging purposes, only for a limited time.

**RudderStack does not persist any of your data**.

However, if you do not wish to sign up for RudderStack and want to self-host the source/destination configurations, you can use the open source <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/control-plane-lite/">Control Plane Lite</Link> utility. To set up the RudderStack server (backend) in your own environment, follow the steps listed in the <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/data-plane-setup/">Data Plane Setup</Link> guide.

<div class="warningBlock">
The control plane set up using Control Plane Lite does not have features like <Link to="/features/transformations/">Transformations</Link> and <Link to="/dashboard-guides/live-events/">Live Events</Link>.

### What is a data plane URL? Where do I get it?

For routing and processing the events to the RudderStack backend, a **data plane URL** is required.

<div class="infoBlock">
Refer to the <Link to="/resources/rudderstack-architecture/">RudderStack Architecture</Link> guide for more information the RudderStack data plane.
</div>

If you're using open source RudderStack, you are required to <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/data-plane-setup/">set up your own data plane</Link> in the preferred environment.

<div class="infoBlock">
An open source RudderStack data plane URL typically looks like <code class="inline-code">http:localhost:8080</code>, where <code class="inline-code">8080</code> is the port where your RudderStack data plane is hosted.
