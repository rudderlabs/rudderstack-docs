## RudderStack-hosted control plane

If you're using a RudderStack-hosted control plane, follow these steps to set up the data plane in your Docker environment:

1. Log into your [RudderStack Open Source dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup?type=opensource).
2. Copy your workspace token from **Settings** > **Company**, as shown:

3. Download the `rudder-docker.yml` [docker-compose](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server/master/rudder-docker.yml) file.
4. Replace `<your_workspace_token>` in this file with the workspace token copied above.
5. Then, open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to install RudderStack, and run the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f rudder-docker.yml up -d
```

## Self-hosted control plane

If you have self-hosted the control plane using the open-source <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/control-plane-lite/">Control Plane Lite</Link> utility, follow <Link to="//get-started/rudderstack-open-source/control-plane-lite/#docker">Docker instructions</Link> to set up the data plane.

## Sending test events

Once you have successfully performed the steps above, follow the <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/sending-test-events/">Sending Test Events</Link> guide to verify the installation.
