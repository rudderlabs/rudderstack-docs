  Step by step guide on installing and setting up the RudderStack backend (data plane) in your preferred environment.
---

The data plane is RudderStack's core engine responsible for processing and routing the events.

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on the data plane, refer to <Link to="/resources/rudderstack-architecture/">RudderStack Architecture</Link>.
</div>

## Setup instructions

Based on the platform where you want to set up RudderStack, refer to the setup instructions:

* <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/data-plane-setup/docker/">Docker</Link>

* <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/data-plane-setup/kubernetes/">Kubernetes</Link>

* <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/data-plane-setup/developer-machine-setup/">Developer Machine Setup</Link>

<div class="infoBlock">
If you are planning to use RudderStack in production, it is strongly recommended to use the <a href="kubernetes/">Kubernetes</a> Helm charts. The Docker images are updated with the latest bug fixes more frequently than the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server">GitHub repository</a>.
</div>

<div class="dangerBlock">
In RudderStack Open Source, every node runs the warehouse sync operations individually. Setting up multiple nodes can cause concurrent requests to your warehouse, leading to failures and retries. It can also increase your costs in the case of data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, etc.

## Sending test events

Once you have installed RudderStack, follow the <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/sending-test-events/">Sending Test Events</Link> guide to verify your installation.

## FAQ

### Do I need to sign up for an account to set up open source RudderStack?

Signing up for [RudderStack Open Source](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup?type=opensource) is the easiest way to set up and manage your data pipelines. The web app is only used for source/destination configuration and does not have access to your data. It also provides a <Link to="/dashboard-guides/live-events/">Live Events</Link> feature for debugging purposes, only for a limited time. 

**RudderStack does not persist any of your data**.

However, if you do not wish to sign up for RudderStack and want to self-host the source/destination configurations, you can use the open source <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/control-plane-lite/">Control Plane Lite</Link> utility. To set up the RudderStack server (backend) in your own environment, follow the steps listed in the [Setup instructions](#setup-instructions) section for your preferred platform.

<div class="warningBlock">
The control plane set up using Control Plane Lite does not have features like <Link to="/features/transformations/">Transformations</Link> and the ability to view <Link to="/dashboard-guides/live-events/">Live Events</Link>.
</div>

### What is a data plane URL? Where do I get it?

For routing and processing the events to the RudderStack backend, a **data plane URL** is required.

<div class="infoBlock">
Refer to the <Link to="/resources/rudderstack-architecture/">RudderStack Architecture</Link> guide for more information the RudderStack data plane.
</div>

If you're using open source RudderStack, you are required to set up your own data plane by [installing and setting up RudderStack](#setup-instructions) in your preferred environment.

<div class="infoBlock">
An open source RudderStack data plane URL typically looks like <code class="inline-code">http:localhost:8080</code>, where <code class="inline-code">8080</code> is the port where your RudderStack data plane is hosted.
</div>

### How to check the status of the data plane?

To check the status of your data plane, run the following command:

```bash
curl <DATA_PLANE_URL>/health
```

A sample command is shown below:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

You will see the following output:

```
{"server":"UP", "db":"UP","acceptingEvents":"TRUE","routingEvents":"TRUE","mode":"NORMAL","goroutines":"15364", "backendConfigMode": "API", "lastSync":"2020-12-01T04:20:33Z", "lastRegulationSync":"2020-11-30T21:40:27Z"}
```

The RudderStack server (backend) supports two running modes:

- **Normal** (`"mode": "NORMAL"`): In this mode, the RudderStack server runs as expected and there are no issues.
- **Degraded** (`"mode": "DEGRADED"`): RudderStack enters the degraded mode if it keeps crashing while processing the events after a threshold number of restarts is reached. RudderStack still receives and stores the events in this mode but does not process them and route them to your specified destinations.

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on the supported running modes, refer to the <Link to="/user-guides/administrators-guide/high-availability/">RudderStack High Availability</Link>guide.
