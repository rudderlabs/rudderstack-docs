  Step-by-step guide on self-hosting your control plane using Control Plane Lite.
---

RudderStack's <Link to="/resources/rudderstack-architecture/#control-plane">control plane</Link> provides a UI that lets you manage your source and destination configurations.

<div class="successBlock">
The easiest way to manage your configurations is through the RudderStack-hosted control plane, i.e., <a href="https://app.rudderstack.com/signup">RudderStack Cloud</a>. RudderStack Cloud does not require development to set up, and offers additional features such as <Link to="/dashboard-guides/live-events/">Live Events</Link> and <Link to="/features/transformations/">Transformations</Link>. In case of doubt, we strongly recommend using RudderStack Cloud to get started.
</div>

To self-host your source-destination configurations, you can use the open source <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/config-generator">Control Plane Lite</a> utility to set up your own control plane. Control Plane Lite lets you manage your data pipelines locally by exporting or importing your configurations from a JSON file.

<div class="dangerBlock">
<a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/config-generator">Control Plane Lite</a> is no longer actively maintained by RudderStack. We encourage contributions from the open source community but note some <a href="https://app.rudderstack.com/signup">RudderStack Cloud</a> features may not be available in your self-hosted control plane, and that we do not plan to support new functionality. 
</div>

## Setting up the control plane

Before setting up your self-hosted control plane, make sure you have installed <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v14.17.3/">Node.js</a>.

<div class="warningBlock">
Use Node.js v14 for the best experience as the higher versions are not supported.
</div>

To set up your self-hosted control plane using Control Plane Lite, follow these steps: 

1. Clone the [RudderStack Control Plane Lite](https://github.com/rudderlabs/config-generator) repository. 
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the **Config Generator** folder. Then, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

3. After the setup is complete, you can access the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Exporting workspace configuration

After adding the required sources and destinations in the dashboard, you can export your workspace configuration by clicking the **EXPORT** button. The configuration is then exported and saved as a JSON file. This file is required to start the RudderStack server.

## Starting RudderStack server with the workspace configuration file

For RudderStack to pick up the exported workspace configuration file, follow the steps in the below sections depending on your setup method.

### Docker

1. Download and open [`rudder-docker.yml`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server/master/rudder-docker.yml).
2. In the `environment` section under `backend` service, uncomment the following lines:

```yaml
  - RSERVER_BACKEND_CONFIG_CONFIG_FROM_FILE=true
  - RSERVER_BACKEND_CONFIG_CONFIG_JSONPATH=<workspace_config_filepath_in_container>
```

3. Then, replace `<workspace_config_filepath_in_container>`  in the above line with your container file path. By default, you can set it to `/etc/rudderstack/workspaceConfig.json`.
4. In the `volumes` section under the `backend` service, uncomment the following line:

```yaml
  - <absolute_path_to_workspace_config>:<workspace_config_filepath_in_container>
```

5. Next, replace `<absolute_path_to_workspace_config>` with the local path of your `workspaceConfig.json`(where your workspace configuration file is saved locally). Also, replace  `<workspace_config_filepath_in_container>`  with the container file path that you set in **Step 3**.

<div class="warningBlock">
The value for <code class="inline-code">&lt;workspace_config_filepath_in_container&gt;</code> should be the same as the value provided for the  <code class="inline-code">RSERVER_BACKEND_CONFIG_CONFIG_JSONPATH</code> variable. Otherwise, your workspace configuration will not be loaded and you will get an error.
</div>

6. At this stage, your `rudder-docker.yml` should look like the following:

<img src="../../assets/rudderstack-open-source/rudder-docker-yml-file.png" alt="Rudder Docker YML file" />

7. Finally, navigate to the directory where you want to install RudderStack and run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f rudder-docker.yml up
```

Once you have completed these steps above successfully, <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/sending-test-events/">send test events</Link>  to verify your installation.

### Kubernetes

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudderstack-helm) containing the RudderStack Helm chart by running the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:rudderlabs/rudderstack-helm.git
```

2. Navigate to the folder containing the Helm chart, as shown:

```bash
cd rudderstack-helm/
```

3. Open the `values.yaml` file.
4. Set the parameter `controlPlaneJSON` to `true`.
5. Export the workspace configuration from the dashboard by following the steps in the [Exporting workspace configuration](#exporting-workspace-configuration) section above. Place the exported file in the `rudderstack-helm` folder.
6. Finally, run the following command:

```bash
helm install my-release ./ --set backend.controlPlaneJSON=true
```

<div class="infoBlock">
Refer to the <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/data-plane-setup/kubernetes/#configuration">Configurable parameters</Link> section for information on the parameters that can be configured during deployment.
</div>

Once you have completed these steps above successfully, <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/sending-test-events/">send test events</Link> to verify your installation.

### Developer machine setup

1. First, set up the database in your preferred directory using the following commands:

```bash
createdb jobsdb
createuser --superuser rudder
psql "jobsdb" -c "alter user rudder with encrypted password 'rudder'";
psql "jobsdb" -c "grant all privileges on database jobsdb to rudder";
```

2. Next, clone the [RudderStack server](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server) repository.  
3. Then, run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` to fetch the `rudder-transformer` repository.  
4. Next, navigate to the **rudder-transformer** directory:

```bash
cd rudder-transformer
```

5. Install the dependencies using the command `npm i` . Then, start the destination transformer using the following command:

```bash
node destTransformer.js
```

6. Navigate back to the main directory using the command `cd rudder-server`. 
7. Next, copy the `sample.env` to the main directory, as shown:

```bash
cp config/sample.env .env
```

8. Then, go to the `config` folder and open `config.yaml`.
9. Under `[BackendConfig]`, look for `configFromFile` and set it to `true`. 
10. Also, change the value of `configJSONPath` to the local path of your `workspaceConfig.json`(where your workspace configuration file is saved locally), as shown:

<img src="../../assets/rudderstack-open-source/rudder-config-1.png" alt="RudderStack config JSON path" />

11. Finally, run the RudderStack server using the following command:

  ```bash
  go run main.go
  ```

Once you have completed these steps above successfully, <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/sending-test-events/">send test events</Link> to verify the installation.

## Using SDK sources set up in self-hosted control plane

To use the RudderStack SDKs set up as sources in the self-hosted control plane, follow these steps:

1. [Set up](#setting-up-the-control-plane) the control plane using the Control Plane Lite utility. 
2. Go to the dashboard, set up your source, and export the source configuration by clicking the **EXPORT SOURCE CONFIG** button, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/rudderstack-open-source/export-source-config.png" alt="Export source config option" />

3. Host the exported file on your server such that it can be accessed via the path `<CONTROL_PLANE_URL>/sourceConfig`. 
4. Provide the base URL of your server (`<CONTROL_PLANE_URL>`) serving this file in your SDK initialization code snippet. For more information on SDK initialization, refer to the following sections in the respective SDK guides:

* <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#loading-sdk-for-self-hosted-control-plane">JavaScript SDK instructions</Link>
* <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-android-sdk/#configuring-your-rudderstack-client">Android SDK instructions</Link>
* <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-ios-sdk/#configuring-the-rudderstack-client">iOS SDK instructions</Link>
* <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-react-native-sdk/">React Native SDK instructions</Link>
* <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-flutter-sdk/flutter-v1/#configuring-your-rudderstack-client">Flutter SDK instructions</Link>

<div class="successBlock">
The RudderStack SDKs automatically fetch the configuration by appending <code class="inline-code">/sourceConfig</code> to the base server URL provided above. For example, <code class="inline-code">&#123;CONTROL_PLANE_URL&#125;/sourceConfig</code>.
</div>

A sample source configuration exported from the dashboard is shown below:
