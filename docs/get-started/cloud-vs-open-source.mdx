  Compare the features and setup options available in RudderStack's two offerings - Cloud and Open Source.
---

If you are evaluating RudderStack in a [build vs. buy](https://www.rudderstack.com/blog/when-to-build-vs-buy-data-pipelines) context, it's important to understand the components and features that make up the RudderStack service as they relate to your current and future needs. Our open source community is one of our greatest resources, and we also offer a generous free tier for our cloud users. Whichever you decide, we are here to support you. 

The purpose of this guide is to help you decide which setup is right based on your environment and data needs: [RudderStack Cloud](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup?type=freetrial) or [RudderStack Open Source](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup?type=opensource). 

## RudderStack Architecture

To understand the effort involved in setting up RudderStack, it's useful to take a look at our architecture which comprises the **Control plane** and the **Data plane**. These two services work together to govern the data flows between your event sources and destinations.

### Control Plane

The control plane is the front-end web application where you manage the configuration of your sources and destinations in RudderStack.

Whether you are using RudderStack open source or cloud, **we recommend using the RudderStack-hosted web app as your control plane**. Our free cloud tier offers 5 million events per month and multiple sources and destinations, and includes live events and transformations, which are unavailable in the open source control plane.  It's also much easier to convert to a paid plan as your needs evolve over time if you are using our hosted control plane.

If you require a self-hosted web app, you can use our [Control Plane Lite](https://github.com/rudderlabs/config-generator) interface. See <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/control-plane-lite">Control Plane Setup</Link> for details.

Cloud-based features like <Link to="/features/transformations/">Transformations</Link> and <Link to="/dashboard-guides/live-events/">Live Events</Link> are not available if you self-host the control plane.

### Data Plane

The data plane is RudderStack's core engine responsible for receiving event data and transforming it into the required destination format before relaying events to the destination.

The data plane comes in two flavors:

- <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-cloud">RudderStack Cloud</Link>: RudderStack-hosted data plane with a generous free plan an Pro and Enterprise options.

See our [Pricing](https://www.rudderstack.com/pricing) page for plan comparisons.

- [rudder-server](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server): Our open source data plane— Run on Docker, Kubernetes, or in your own environment.


## Setup

### Cloud

In <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-cloud/">RudderStack Cloud</Link>, we host the data plane and the control plane so you don't have to worry about their setup. Sign up for free, set up a source and start seeing events within minutes.

### Open Source

For <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/">RudderStack Open Source</Link> you have the following data plane and control plane setup options:

  - <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/data-plane-setup/">Set up the data plane</Link> in your own environment. <strong>RudderStack will not host it for you</strong>.

  - For the control plane, you can either use the [RudderStack-hosted control plane](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup?type=opensource) or <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/control-plane-lite/">set up your own control plane</Link>.

<div class="warningBlock">

If you are unsure, we strongly advise using the free hosted version of the control plane to start.
