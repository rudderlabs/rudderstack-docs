## FAQ

### What is the data plane and control plane in RudderStack? How do I set them up?

The data plane is RudderStack's core engine responsible for receiving event data and transforming it into the required destination format before relaying events to the destination.

The control plane is the front-end web application where you manage the configuration of your sources and destinations in RudderStack.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the data plane and control plane in RudderStack, refer to the <Link to="/resources/rudderstack-architecture/">RudderStack Architecture</Link> guide.
</div>

In <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-cloud/">RudderStack Cloud</Link>, we host the data plane and the control plane so you don't have to worry about their setup.

- <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/data-plane-setup/">Set up the data plane</Link> in your own environment. <strong>RudderStack will not host it for you</strong>.
- For the control plane, you can either use the [RudderStack-hosted control plane](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup?type=opensource) or <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/control-plane-lite/">set up your own control plane</Link>.
