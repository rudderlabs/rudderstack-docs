## Cloud and Open Source setup

To understand the effort involved in setting up RudderStack, it's useful to take a look at RudderStack's architecture which comprises the <Link to="/resources/rudderstack-architecture/#control-plane">**control plane**</Link> and the <Link to="/resources/rudderstack-architecture/#data-plane">**data plane**</Link>. These two services work together to govern the data flow between your event sources and destinations.

<div class="infoBlock">
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>control plane</strong> refers to the front-end RudderStack dashboard where you can manage the configuration of your sources and destinations.</li>
  <li>The <strong>data plane</strong> is RudderStack's core engine responsible for receiving event data and transforming it into the required destination format before relaying events to the destination.</li>
</ul>
</div>

### RudderStack Cloud

In <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-cloud/">RudderStack Cloud</Link>, you get a RudderStack-hosted data plane and control plane so you need not worry about the setup. <a href="https://app.rudderstack.com/signup/">Sign up</a> for free, set up a source and destination, and start seeing the events flow within minutes.

RudderStack's free cloud tier offers multiple sources, destinations and delivery of 5 million events per month. It provides key features like <Link to="/dashboard-guides/live-events/">Live Events</Link> and <Link to="/features/transformations/">Transformations</Link>. If you start on the cloud free tier, it's much easier to convert to a <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/pricing">paid plan</a> as your needs evolve over time.

### RudderStack Open Source

For <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/">RudderStack Open Source</Link>, you have the following data plane and control plane setup options:

1. <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/data-plane-setup/">Set up the data plane</Link> on Docker, Kubernetes, or in your own development environment. <strong>RudderStack will not host the data plane for you</strong>.

1. Set up the control plane using one of the following options:
  - Use the [RudderStack-hosted control plane](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup?type=opensource) (<strong>recommended</strong>).
  - Self-host your source-destination configurations by setting up your own control plane using <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/control-plane-lite/">Control Plane Lite</Link>.

<div class="warningBlock">
Cloud-based features like <Link to="/features/transformations/">Transformations</Link> and <Link to="/dashboard-guides/live-events/">Live Events</Link> are not available if you use the <em>Control Plane Lite</em> utility. If you are unsure, it is highly recommended you use <Link to="#rudderstack-cloud">RudderStack Cloud</Link> to get started.
