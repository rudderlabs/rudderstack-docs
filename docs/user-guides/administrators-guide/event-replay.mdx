  Detailed technical description of RudderStack's events backup and replay feature.
---

RudderStack's **event replay** feature lets you back up your event data and replay it in case of any failures. Some scenarios where you can leverage this functionality include:

- Replay failed events from a particular date to a destination, maybe due to some misconfiguration.
- Replay all the events for a particular source, from a particular date, to a new event stream or warehouse destination.

## Supported event types for replay

RudderStack can store the following types of event data and replay it to the specified destinations:

- Raw events captured through various sources. RudderStack stores these events in batches of 100,000 events.
- Event payloads sent by RudderStack in case of delivery failures along with the errors (stored approximately every 30 seconds).

## Data storage options

RudderStack offers the following data storage options for event replay functionality:

- **No data storage** (default): RudderStack does not store any event data and hence it cannot be replayed.
- **Connect your own object storage** (recommended): Event data is stored in your object storage. RudderStack currently supports Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, and MinIO as the object storage options. 
- **RudderStack cloud storage**: Event data is stored in RudderStack's Amazon S3 bucket on a rolling 30-day basis. That is, RudderStack deletes the event data 30 days after it was stored.
