title: "Bucket Configuration Settings for Event Backups"
description: Configure cloud-specific buckets for your event backups.
---

Depending on your <Link to="/dashboard-guides/data-retention/">data retention policy</Link>, RudderStack stores the following two types of events:

* All the raw events ingested by RudderStack.
* The final event payload along with the error, in case of delivery failures.

<div class="successBlock">
The events are deleted from the bucket upon successful delivery of the events. <strong>RudderStack does not persist any of the customer data</strong>.
</div>

Follow the steps in this guide if you want RudderStack to back up the events in your **own** cloud-specific bucket.

## Bucket configuration settings

If you are using **RudderStack Open Source** and want to use your own bucket to store the events, you will need to enable and set certain variables in your RudderStack backend.

### Docker setup

#### Storing events into your S3 bucket

To capture the events in your S3 bucket, uncomment the following lines in your [docker.env](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server/blob/master/build/docker.env#L45-L50) file: 

```
# JOBS_BACKUP_STORAGE_PROVIDER=S3
# JOBS_BACKUP_BUCKET=<your_s3_bucket>
# JOBS_BACKUP_PREFIX=<prefix>
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
```

Then follow these steps:

1. Specify your S3 bucket name for the variable `JOBS_BACKUP_BUCKET`.
2. Add the specific AWS IAM keys by following the <Link to="#permissions-for-amazon-s3">Permissions for Amazon S3</Link> section below.

<div class="infoBlock">
The <code class="inline-code">&lt;prefix&gt;</code> value for the <strong><code class="inline-code">JOBS_BACKUP_PREFIX</code></strong> variable refers to the path under the bucket in which RudderStack stores the data. 
For example, if <strong><code class="inline-code">JOBS_BACKUP_PREFIX</code></strong> is set to <strong><code class="inline-code">prefix</code></strong>  then RudderStack stores the data in the location <strong><code class="inline-code">&lt;your_s3_bucket&gt;/prefix</code></strong>.
</div>

#### Storing events into your GCS bucket

To capture the events in your GCS bucket, uncomment the following lines in your [docker.env](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server/blob/master/build/docker.env#L45-L50) file: 

```
# JOBS_BACKUP_STORAGE_PROVIDER=GCS
# JOBS_BACKUP_BUCKET=<your_gcs_bucket>
# JOBS_BACKUP_PREFIX=<prefix>
# GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/credentials
```

Then, follow these steps:

1. Specify your GCS bucket name for the variable `JOBS_BACKUP_BUCKET`.
2. Specify the location of the downloaded JSON file containing the required permissions for the variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`. You can obtain this JSON file by referring to the <Link to ="#permissions-for-gcs">Permissions for GCS</Link> section below.

### Kubernetes Setup

Similar to the Docker setup, you can configure your bucket settings by changing the values in the [values.yaml](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudderstack-helm/blob/master/values.yaml#L87) file.

## Permissions for Amazon S3

Follow these steps to use your own S3 bucket for RudderStack to store the events:

1. Create a bucket using the Amazon [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) service.  
2. Create a new [customer-managed policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_managed-policies.html) with the following JSON:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:AbortMultipartUpload"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::{BUCKET_NAME}/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

3. Create a new group and add the policy created above to this group. 
4. Create a new [user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) in [Identity and Access Management \(IAM\)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam) with the programmatic access and add the user to the above group. 
5. Download and note the **Access key ID** and **Secret Access Key**.

## Permissions for GCS

This section lists the steps to use your own GCS bucket for RudderStack to store the events: 

Under **Roles** in your GCP dashboard, you need to create a role with the following permissions:

  * **storage.objects.create**
  * **storage.objects.get**

<div class="infoBlock">
It is highly recommended to add each permission one after the other.
</div>

Then, create a service account by following these steps:

1. Assign a name to the service account:


<img src="../../assets/screenshot-2020-08-05-at-11.40.12-am (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (1).png" alt="Assign a name" />

2. Add the role you created in step 1.


<img src="../../assets/screenshot-2020-08-05-at-11.41.24-am.png" alt="" />

3. Create a key with the type JSON and save this file locally:


<img src="../../assets/screenshot-2020-08-05-at-11.49.10-am.png" alt="Create a key" />


4. Then, create a bucket with the bucket access control set to **Uniform**:


<img src="../../assets/screenshot-2020-08-05-at-11.52.07-am.png" alt="Create a bucket" />

Once the bucket is created, add the required permissions by following the below steps:

1. Go to the **Permissions** tab.
2. Then, add the member with the service account created above.
3. Add the role.

<img src="../../assets/screenshot-2020-08-05-at-11.53.34-am.png" alt="Go to Permissions" />

4. Finally, download the JSON file containing the required permissions.
