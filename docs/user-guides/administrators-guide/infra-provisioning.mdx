# Infrastructure Provisioning

This is a brief overview of the stats that we captured by running Backend on different AWS machine configurations that we hope gives a rough idea for users in making the decisions to provision infrastructure to host Rudder. All numbers capture below are by using metrics described in [Monitoring and Metrics](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/user-guides/administrators-guide/monitoring-and-metrics/#available-metrics).

## Load Test Results

All tests are done using db.m4.xlarge Amazon RDS instance for hosting the postgres database

Backend migrates and drops tables that have a threshold of jobs processed. Gateway tables are backed up to object storage (S3, MinIO etc.) if configured by user. Dangling tables indicate tables are ready for drop at a rate greater than the rate at which tables are backed up to object storage. Concurrent uploads to object storage is in the roadmap for upcoming versions of Backend.

## Database Requirements

Rudder recommends using a database with at least 1TB allocated storage as there could be downtime to increase storage realtime depending on your database service provider.

### Estimating Storage

If you want to dig deeper and figure out the right storage size, go through the following example.  
Following variables should be considered to come with a right storage size for your use case.

| Variable        | Description                                                                                            | Production sample data |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| numSources      | Total number of sources                                                                                | 2                      |
| numEventsPerSec | Number of events per sec for a given source                                                            | 2500                   |
| avgGwEventSize  | Event size that is captured at the gateway by Rudder                                                   | 2.1 KB                 |
| gwEventOverhead | Size of extra metadata that Rudder stores at Gateway to process the event                              | 300 B                  |
| numDests        | Number of enabled destinations for a given source                                                      | 3                      |
| avgRtEventSize  | The payload size that needs to be sent by the router to the destination after applying transformations | 1.2 KB                 |
| rtEventOverhead | Size of extra metadata that Rudder stores to process the event                                         | 300 B                  |

<BlockMath>
gatewayStorage = numEventsPerSec * (avgGwEventSize + gwEventOverhead)
</BlockMath>

<BlockMath>
routerStorage = numEventsPerSec * numDests
 * (avgRtEventSize + rtEventOverhead)
</BlockMath>

<BlockMath>
totalStoragePerHour = 3600 * \sum_&#123;firstSource&#125;^&#123;lastSource&#125; (gatewayStorage + routerStorage)
</BlockMath>

In the above production example, after substituting the values, _totalStoragePerHour_ adds up to _**120 GB**_

Sample your peak load in production to estimate the storage requirements and substitute your values to get an estimate of the storage needed per 1 hour of data.

<div class="infoBlock">

Event data and tables are ephemeral. In a happy path, we would have only a few minutes of event data being stored.

We recommend at least 10 hours worth of event storage computed above to gracefully handle destinations going down for a few hours.

If you want to prepare for a destination going for down for days, accommodate them into your storage capacity.

</div>

### Estimating Connections

Rudder batches requests efficiently to write data. Under heavy load, backend can be configured \(`batchTimeoutInMS` and `maxBatchSize` \) to batch more requests to limit concurrent connections to the database. If write latencies to the database are not in permissible thresholds, a new data set needs to be added i.e., backend server and database server.

Rudder reads the data back from the database at a constant rate. A sudden spike in user traffic will not result in more read DB requests.

## RAM Requirements

Rudder does not cache aggressively and hence does not need huge amount of memory. Load tests were performed on 4 GB and 8 GB memory instances.

Rudder caches active user events by default to form configurable user sessions server side. The length of any user session can be configured with `sessionThresholdInS` and `sessionThresholdEvents`. Once a user's session is formed, that user events are cleared from the cache. If you don't need sessions, this can be disabled by setting `processSessions` to `false`.

| Variable                | Description                                                                             | Sample data |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------- |
| `numActiveUsers`        | Number of active users during a session \(2 min\) in your application during peak hours | 10000       |
| `avgGwEventSize`        | Event size that is captured at the gateway by Rudder                                    | 2.1 KB      |
| `userEventsInThreshold` | Number of user events in the given threshold i.e., 40 user events in 2 min              | 40          |

<BlockMath>
memoryNeeded = numActiveUsers * userEventsInThreshold * avgGwEventSize
</BlockMath>

Memory required in the above example would be 840 MB.

<div class="infoBlock">

The memory estimate does not include the default RAM required for running the OS and the required processes.
