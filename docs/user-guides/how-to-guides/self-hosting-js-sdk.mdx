This guide will take you through the detailed steps to self-host RudderStack JavaScript SDK on your own CDN or storage:

1. Download the [JavaScript SDK](https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/rudder-analytics.min.js) and save it as `rudder-analytics.min.js`.
2. Navigate to the required device mode destination SDKs by replacing the destination name from the URL: https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/js-integrations/&lt;destination_name&gt;.min.js

    - Download the `<destination_name>.min.js` file from https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/js-integrations/&lt;destination_name&gt;.min.js 
    - Download the `<destination_name>.min.js.map` file from https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/js-integrations/&lt;destination_name&gt;.min.js.map 

For example, you can download `HubSpot.min.js` and `HubSpot.min.js.map` files from  https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/js-integrations/HubSpot.min.js and  https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/js-integrations/HubSpot.min.js.map respectively.

Downloading and hosting the source map files (<code class="inline-code">&lt;destination_name&gt;.min.js.map</code>) is optional but recommended to help in troubleshooting.

3. Move the files downloaded in the above steps in a recommended directory structure as:

4. Add the following script tag in your `rudder-analytics.min.js` file, as shown:

```html
<script src="https://<subdomain>.<yourdomain>.com/<path-to-sdk-base-directory>/rudder-analytics.min.js"></script>
```
