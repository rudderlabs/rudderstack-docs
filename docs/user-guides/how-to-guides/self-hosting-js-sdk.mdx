This guide will take you through the detailed steps to self-host RudderStack JavaScript SDK on your own CDN or storage:

1. Download the [JavaScript SDK](https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/rudder-analytics.min.js) and save the file name as `rudder-analytics.min.js`.

2. Navigate to the required device mode destination SDKs by replacing the destination name from the URL: https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/js-integrations/&lt;destination_name&gt;.min.js and download the `<destination_name>.min.js` and `<destination_name>.min.js.map` files. For example,  `HubSpot.min.js` and `HubSpot.min.js.map` files for the HubSpot destination.
