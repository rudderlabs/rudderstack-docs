description: Step-by-step guide on hosting RudderStack JavaScript SDK on your own CDN or storage.
---

This guide walks you through the steps to self-host the RudderStack JavaScript SDK and also covers different scenarios based on your directory structure.

1. Download the [JavaScript SDK](https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/rudder-analytics.min.js) and save it as `rudder-analytics.min.js`. Also, download the [corresponding source map file](https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/rudder-analytics.min.js.map), and save it as `rudder-analytics.min.js.map`.
2. Download the required device mode destination SDK file (`<dest_name>.min.js`) and its corresponding source map file (`<dest_name>.min.js.map`) from [RudderStack CDN](https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/list_integration_sdks.html).

<div class="infoBlock">
Downloading and hosting the source map files (<code class="inline-code">rudder-analytics.min.js.map</code> or <code class="inline-code">&lt;dest_name&gt;.min.js.map</code>) is optional but recommended to help in troubleshooting.
</div>

3. Move the files downloaded in the above steps in the following directory structure:

4. Add the following script tag in your website:

```javascript
<script>
rudderanalytics=window.rudderanalytics=[];for(var methods=["load","page","track","identify","alias","group","ready","reset","getAnonymousId","setAnonymousId","getUserId","getUserTraits","getGroupId","getGroupTraits"],i=0;i<methods.length;i++){var method=methods[i];rudderanalytics[method]=function(a){return function(){rudderanalytics.push([a].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)))}}(method)}rudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY,DATA_PLANE_URL),rudderanalytics.page();
</script>

<script src="https://<subdomain>.<yourdomain>.com/<path-to-sdk-base-directory>/rudder-analytics.min.js"></script>
```

## Alternate directory structure

If you have a specific use-case where you need to follow a directory structure different than the one recommended above, follow the steps 1 and 2, and proceed with one of the below depending on your directory structure:

- If your JavaScript SDK file name is `rudder-analytics.min.js`, but the destination SDKs are **not** located next to it under the `js-integrations` directory, add the following script tag in your website:

 ```html
 <script>
 // rudderanalytics object initialization
 // provide the location of the destination SDKs in the load options
 rudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {
     destSDKBaseURL: "https://<subdomain>.<yourdomain>.com/<path-to-integration-sdks-directory>"
 });
 // ...
 </script>
 <script src="https://<subdomain>.<yourdomain>.com/<path-to-sdk-base-directory>/rudder-analytics.min.js"></script>
 ```

- If your JavaScript SDK file name is **not** `rudder-analytics.min.js`, and the destination SDKs are **not** located under the `js-integrations` directory, add the following script tag in your website:

<div class="infoBlock"> 
This option is recommended, as providing a custom name for the core JavaScript SDK file (instead of <code class="inline-code">rudder-analytics.min.js</code>) can help overcome the ad-blockers, if any.
</div>

 ```html
 <script>
 // rudderanalytics object initialization
 // provide the location of the destination SDKs in the load options
 rudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {
     destSDKBaseURL: "https://<subdomain>.<yourdomain>.com/<path-to-integration-sdks-directory>"
 });
 // ...
 </script>
 <script src="https://<subdomain>.<yourdomain>.com/<path-to-custom-sdk-file>/<custom-sdk-file-name.js>"></script>
 ```
