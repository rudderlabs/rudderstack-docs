  Step-by-step guide to integrate RudderStack with your Eleventy site for event tracking.
---

This guide will help you integrate RudderStack with your Eleventy site using the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/">JavaScript SDK</Link>. On successful integration, you can track and send real-time user events to your preferred destinations via RudderStack.

To set up the event streams on your Eleventy site, you need to perform the following steps:

1. [Integrate the JavaScript SDK with your Eleventy site and set up the tracking code](#integrating-the-javascript-sdk-with-your-eleventy-site)
2. [Configure a destination in RudderStack](#configuring-a-destination-in-rudderstack)
3. [Deploy your Eleventy site and verify the events](#deploying-your-eleventy-site-and-verifying-the-event-stream)

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have installed and set up your Eleventy site. Refer to the [Eleventy documentation](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/getting-started/) for more information.

## Integrating the JavaScript SDK with your Eleventy site

Integrating the JavaScript SDK with your Eleventy site involves the following steps:

1. [Creating a JavaScript source in RudderStack](#creating-a-javascript-source-in-rudderstack) 
2. [Installing and configuring the JavaScript SDK in your Eleventy site](#installing-and-configuring-the-javascript-sdk-in-your-eleventy-site)

### Creating a JavaScript source in RudderStack

The RudderStack JavaScript source is required track the events from your Eleventy site. Follow these steps to set it up in your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/):

1. Note the data plane URL in your RudderStack dashboard. This is required to set up the JavaScript SDK in your site.

2. Click on the **Sources** button in the left navigation bar and select **New Source** to create a source. Then, select **Event Streams** under **Sources**, and select **JavaScript**.

3. Assign a name to your source and click **Next**.

4. Your JavaScript source is now configured. Note down the write key for this source, as shown:

### Installing and configuring the JavaScript SDK in your Eleventy site

To integrate RudderStack with your Eleventy site and set up the tracking code, follow the steps below:

1. In your Eleventy project, navigate to the `_site` folder and open `index.html`.
2. Add the following script within the `head` tag of the page:

```html
<script>
rudderanalytics = window.rudderanalytics = [];
for (var methods = ["load", "page", "track", "identify", "alias", "group", "ready", "reset", "getAnonymousId", "setAnonymousId"], i = 0; i < methods.length; i++) {
  var method = methods[i];
  rudderanalytics[method] = function(a) {
    return function() {
      rudderanalytics.push([a].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)))
    }
  }(method)
}
rudderanalytics.load("<WRITE_KEY>", "<DATA_PLANE_URL"),
  rudderanalytics.page();
rudderanalytics.track(
  "Test Event in 11ty", {
    revenue: 30,
    currency: 'INR',
    user_actual_id: 12345
  },
  () => {
    console.log("Track call");
  }
);
</script>
<script src="https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/rudder-analytics.min.js"></script>
```

3. Replace `<WRITE_KEY>` and `<DATA_PLANE_URL> with your JavaScript source write key and the data plane URL obtained in the [Creating a JavaScript source in RudderStack](#creating-a-javascript-source-in-rudderstack) section above.

Refer to the sample Eleventy site in the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-samples">RudderStack Sample Applications</a> repository for more information.
</div>

## Configuring a destination in RudderStack

This section details the steps required to set up a destination platform in RudderStack, where you can send all the events tracked by the JavaScript SDK.

<div class="infoBlock">
For this guide, Google Analytics is added as a destination.
</div>

1. Click on **Add Destination** in RudderStack dashboard's home page.
2. Choose **Google Analytics** from the list of destinations.
3. Assign a name to your destination and click **Next**.
4. Select the JavaScript source configured in the above section and click **Next**.
5. Configure your Google Analytics destination with your Google Analytics **Tracking ID** in the **Connection Settings** page. For details on the other settings, refer to the <Link to="/destinations/streaming-destinations/google-analytics-ga/">Google Analytics documentation</Link>.

<div class="infoBlock">
Optionally, you can add a <Link to="/features/transformations/">user transformations</Link> to this destination to transform your events before sending them to Google Analytics. 
</div>

Google Analytics is now configured as a destination. You should be able to see the connection in your RudderStack dashboard, as seen below:

<div class="successBlock">
You can also set up a warehouse destination in RudderStack and send your tracked events to it.
</div>

## Deploying your Eleventy site and verifying the event stream

To verify if your event stream is working correctly, deploy your Eleventy site and test if the events are tracked and delivered correctly. Follow these steps:

1. From your terminal, navigate to the folder containing your Eleventy site and run the following command:

```bash
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

2. Open the local server URL(generally `http://localhost:8080/`) in your browser to view the site.
4. Go to your browser's developer tools and check the **Network** tab to verify if the RudderStack JavaScript SDK (`rudder-analytics.js`) is loaded correctly.  The following image highlights this option for Google Chrome:

5. Click on the various links or pages in your site for RudderStack to track these actions.
6. Go to the **Live Events** tab of your JavaScript source in the RudderStack dashboard to check if the events are tracked:

<img src="../../../assets/user-guides/live-events.png" alt="RudderStack live events tab" />

<div class="infoBlock">
You may face a minor delay before the events start showing up in your dashboard and the destination.
</div>

7. Upon successful tracking, you will see the events in your RudderStack dashboard:

<img src="../../../assets/user-guides/successful-live-events.png" alt="RudderStack live events tab" />

6. Go to the Google Analytics dashboard and navigate to **Realtime** > **Events** option to check if the events are delivered. Your tracked events will be shown in this window along with other metrics such as number of active users, source platform, etc.
