description: Integrate RudderStack with your Jekyll site for event tracking.
---

This guide will help you integrate RudderStack with your Jekyll site using the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/">RudderStack JavaScript SDK</Link>. On successful integration, you can track and send real-time user events to your preferred destinations via RudderStack.

To set up the event stream on your Jekyll site, you need to perform the following steps:

1. <Link to="#integrating-the-javascript-sdk-with-your-jekyll-site">Integrate the JavaScript SDK with your Jekyll site and set up the tracking code</Link>
2. <Link to="#configuring-a-destination-in-rudderstack">Configure a destination in RudderStack</Link>
3. <Link to="#deploying-your-jekyll-site-and-verifying-the-event-stream">Deploy your Jekyll site and verify the events</Link>

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have installed and set up your Jekyll site. Refer to the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) for more information.

## Integrating the JavaScript SDK with your Jekyll site

Integrating the JavaScript SDK with your Jekyll site involves the following steps:

1. <Link to="#creating-a-javascript-source-in-rudderstack">Creating a JavaScript source in RudderStack</Link> 
2. <Link to="#installing-and-configuring-the-javascript-sdk-in-your-jekyll-site">Installing and configuring the JavaScript SDK in your Jekyll site</Link>

### Creating a JavaScript source in RudderStack

The RudderStack JavaScript source is required track the events from your Jekyll site. Follow these steps to set it up in your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/):

1. Note the data plane URL in your RudderStack dashboard. This is required to set up the JavaScript SDK in your Jekyll site.

2. Click on the **Sources** button in the left navigation bar and select **New Source** to create a source. Then, select **Event Streams** under **Sources**, and select **JavaScript**.

<img src="../../../assets/user-guides/rudderstack-directory.png" alt="RudderStack directory" />

3. Assign a name to your source and click **Next**.
4. Your JavaScript source is now configured. Note down the write key for this source, as shown:

<img src="../../../assets/user-guides/javascript-writekey.png" alt="RudderStack dashboard" />

### Installing and configuring the JavaScript SDK in your Jekyll site

Jekyll has an extensive theme system that helps customize your site's presentation. **Minima** is Jekyllâ€™s default theme. You can check your default Jekyll theme using the following command:

```bash
bundle info --path
```

The following command opens an explorer window showing the theme files and directories:

```bash
open $(bundle info --path)
```

To integrate RudderStack with your Jekyll site and set up the tracking code, follow the steps below:

1. Create a `rudder.html` inside the `_includes` folder in your Jekyll theme's folder and include the following script:

```html
<script>
  rudderanalytics = window.rudderanalytics = [];
  var methods = [
    "load",
    "page",
    "track",
    "identify",
    "alias",
    "group",
    "ready",
    "reset",
    "setAnonymousId",
    "getAnonymousId",
  ];
  for (var i = 0; i < methods.length; i++) {
    var method = methods[i];
    rudderanalytics[method] = (function (methodName) {
      return function () {
        rudderanalytics.push(
          [methodName].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments))
        );
      };
    })(method);
  }
  rudderanalytics.load(
    "WRITE_KEY",
    "DATA_PLANE_URL"
  );
  rudderanalytics.ready(function () {
    console.log("Application is ready with JS");
  });
  rudderanalytics.track("Simple track call");
</script>
<script src="https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/rudder-analytics.min.js"></script>
```
<div class="infoBlock">
If you are using an older version of the JavaScript SDK (v1), refer to the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/version-migration-guide/">Version Migration Guide</Link> to migrate to v1.1.
</div>

2. Replace `<WRITE_KEY>` and `<DATA_PLANE_URL>` with your JavaScript source write key and the data plane URL obtained in the <Link to="#creating-a-javascript-source-in-rudderstack">Creating a JavaScript source in RudderStack</Link> section above.
3. Go to the `_includes/head.html` file of your theme folder and run the following command:

```bash
{%- include rudder.html -%}
```

<div class="infoBlock">
Refer to the sample Jekyll site in the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-samples">RudderStack Sample Applications</a> repository for more information.
</div>

## Configuring a destination in RudderStack

This section details the steps required to set up a destination platform in RudderStack, where you can send all the events tracked by the JavaScript SDK.

<div class="infoBlock">
For this guide, Google Analytics is added as a destination.
</div>

1. Click on **Add Destination** in RudderStack dashboard's home page.
2. Choose **Google Analytics** from the list of destinations.
3. Assign a name to your destination and click **Next**.
4. Select the JavaScript source configured in the above section and click **Next**.
5. Configure your Google Analytics destination with your Google Analytics **Tracking ID** in the **Connection Settings** page. For details on the other settings, refer to the <Link to="/destinations/streaming-destinations/google-analytics-ga/">Google Analytics documentation</Link>.

<img src="../../../assets/user-guides/ga-settings.png" alt="Google Analytics destination configuration" />

<div class="infoBlock">
Optionally, you can add a <Link to="/features/transformations/">transformation</Link> to this destination to transform your events before sending them to Google Analytics. 
</div>

Google Analytics is now configured as a destination. You should be able to see the connection in your RudderStack dashboard, as seen below:

<img src="../../../assets/user-guides/rudderstack-ga-connection.png" alt="Google Analytics connection" />

<div class="successBlock">
You can also set up a warehouse destination in RudderStack and send your tracked events to it.
</div>

## Deploying your Jekyll site and verifying the event stream

To verify if your event stream is working correctly, deploy your Jekyll site and test if the events are tracked and delivered correctly. Follow these steps:

1. From your terminal, navigate to the folder containing your Jekyll site and run following command:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

2. Open the local server URL(generally `http://localhost:4000/`) in your browser to view the site.
3. Go to your browser's developer tools and check the **Network** tab to verify if the RudderStack JavaScript SDK (`rudder-analytics.js`) is loaded correctly. The following image highlights this option for the Google Chrome browser:

<img src="../../../assets/user-guides/browser-network-tab.png" alt="Chrome Network tab" />

4. Click on the various links or pages in your site for RudderStack to track these actions.
5. Go to the **Live Events** tab of your JavaScript source in the RudderStack dashboard to check if the events are tracked.

<img src="../../../assets/user-guides/live-events.png" alt="RudderStack live events tab" />

<div class="infoBlock">
You may face a minor delay before the events start showing up in your dashboard and the destination.
</div>

6. Upon successful tracking, you will see the events in your RudderStack dashboard:

<img src="../../../assets/user-guides/successful-live-events.png" alt="RudderStack live events tab" />

7. In your Google Analytics dashboard, go to **Realtime** > **Events** to check if the events are delivered. Your tracked events will be shown in this window along with other metrics such as number of active users, source platform, etc.
