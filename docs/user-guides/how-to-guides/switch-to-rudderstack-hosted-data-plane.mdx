## Detailed steps

Follow the steps below to switch from self-hosted to RudderStack-hosted data plane:

1. Update the `dataPlaneUrl` parameter in all your SDK configurations to point to the RudderStack-hosted hosted data plane URL. Refer to the specific <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/">SDK documentation</Link> or this <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/data-plane-setup/#what-is-a-data-plane-url-where-do-i-get-it">FAQ</Link> for details on obtaining the data plane URL.

2. Verify that the self-hosted data plane is no longer getting any requests. 

<div class="infoBlock">
One way to do this is to check your load balancer metrics to verify if any requests are still received on your data plane.

3. Ensure that all the events received in the self-hosted data plane are delivered.

It is recommended to keep the self-hosted plane running for a day or two to ensure that all the events are delievered.

4. Shut down the self-hosted data plane depending on your deployment method. For example, if you have deployed the data plane using Helm, run the following command:

```BASH
helm delete <rudderstack-release-name>
```

<div class="infoBlock">
Replace the <code class="inline-code">rudderstack-release-name</code> with the release name of the Helm chart you want to delete.

## Best practices

* In case of mobile SDKs, your customers need to update their mobile applications. You can keep the self-hosted data plane online until a satisfactory number of customers have updated their mobile application or there are no more events coming in to the self-hosted data plane.

  Alternatively, you can run an API Gateway or Cloudflare workers to proxy the requests from your self-hosted data plane URL to the RudderStack-hosted data plane URL.

* In case of mobile SDKs, if you are using Firebase to serve the values like `writeKey` and `dataPlaneUrl`, there is no need to update the mobile application to point to the RudderStack-hosted data plane.

* This process of switching the data plane can hamper the order of events as the events are sent both from the RudderStack-hosted and self-hosted data plane at the same time **for a while**. Hence, it is recommended to choose a low-traffic time slot to carry out this activity.
