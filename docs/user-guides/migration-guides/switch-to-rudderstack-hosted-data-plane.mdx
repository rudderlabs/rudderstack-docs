  Step-by-step guide on switching from your self-hosted control plane and data plane to RudderStack Cloud.
---

This guide is helpful if you want to migrate from your self-hosted RudderStack instance to RudderStack Cloud.

## Step 1: Control plane migration

<div class="warningBlock">
This section is applicable only if you're self-hosting your control plane using the <Link to="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/control-plane-lite/">Control Plane Lite</Link> utility. If you're using the <a href="https://app.rudderstack.com/signup?type=opensource">RudderStack-hosted control plane</a> for your source-destination configurations, skip to the <Link to="#step-2-data-plane-migration">Step 2: Data plane migration</Link> section.
</div>

Follow these steps to switch from your self-hosted RudderStack control plane to RudderStack Cloud:

1. Sign up for <a href="https://app.rudderstack.com/signup">RudderStack Cloud</a>.
2. Set up your sources and destinations.

<div class="infoBlock">
While you can <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/control-plane-lite/#exporting-workspace-configuration">export your source-destination configurations</Link> in your self-hosted control plane, there is no way to import them in RudderStack Cloud. Hence, you will have to set up the configurations manually.
</div>

## Step 2: Data plane migration

Follow the steps below to switch from the self-hosted data plane to RudderStack-hosted data plane:

1. Update the `dataPlaneUrl` parameter in all your SDK configurations to point to the RudderStack-hosted hosted data plane URL. Refer to the specific <Link to="/sources/sdks/">SDK documentation</Link> or this <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/data-plane-setup/#what-is-a-data-plane-url-where-do-i-get-it">FAQ</Link> for details on obtaining the data plane URL.
2. Verify that the self-hosted data plane is no longer getting any requests. 

<div class="infoBlock">
One way to do this is to check your load balancer metrics to verify if any requests are still received on your data plane.
</div>

3. Ensure that all the events received in the self-hosted data plane are delivered. 

<div class="infoBlock">
It is recommended to keep the self-hosted data plane running for a day or two to ensure that all the events are delievered.
</div>

4. Shut down the self-hosted data plane depending on your deployment method. For example, if you have deployed the data plane using Helm, run the following command:

```BASH
helm delete <rudderstack-release-name>
```

<div class="infoBlock">
Replace the <code class="inline-code">rudderstack-release-name</code> with the release name of the Helm chart you want to delete.
</div>

## Best practices

* In case of mobile SDKs, your customers need to update their mobile applications. You can keep the self-hosted data plane online until a satisfactory number of customers have updated their mobile application or there are no more events coming in to the self-hosted data plane. 

  Alternatively, you can run an API Gateway or Cloudflare workers to proxy the requests from your self-hosted data plane URL to the RudderStack-hosted data plane URL.
* In case of mobile SDKs, if you are using Firebase to serve the values like `writeKey` and `dataPlaneUrl`, there is no need to update the mobile application to point to the RudderStack-hosted data plane.
* This process of switching the data plane can hamper the order of events as the events are sent both from the RudderStack-hosted and self-hosted data plane at the same time **for a while**. Hence, it is recommended to choose a low-traffic time slot to carry out this activity.
