  Step by step guide on sending test events to verify your RudderStack installation.

<div class="infoBlock">
This guide assumes that you have already <Link to="/tmp-get-started/rudderstack-open-source/data-plane-setup/">installed and set up RudderStack</Link> in your preferred environment.
</div>

You can follow any of the two approaches to send test events and verify your RudderStack installation:

- Bundled shell script
- RudderStack's HTTP API

## Bundled shell script

The [RudderStack GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server) contains a bundled shell script that generates test events. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server) by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server.git
```

Then, follow the steps below to send test events.

### Step 1: Getting the source write key

#### RudderStack Open Source dashboard

If you have signed up for [RudderStack Open Source](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup?type=opensource), follow these steps to get the source write key:

1. Set up a source and a destination in RudderStack.
2. You can find the write key in the source details page, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/rudderstack-open-source/source-write-key.png" alt="RudderStack source write key" />

<div class="warningBlock">
The source write key is different from your <Link to="/dashboard-guides/overview/#workspace-token">workspace token</Link>. The write key is associated with the source, while the workspace token is associated with your RudderStack workspace.
</div>

#### Self-hosted control plane

If you are self-hosting RudderStack and have set up the control plane using the <Link to="/tmp-get-started/rudderstack-open-source/control-plane-lite/">Control Plane Lite</Link> utility, you can obtain the source write key by following these steps:

1. Set up a source and a destination.
2. Note the write key associated with the source in the dashboard as shown:

<img src="../../assets/rudderstack-open-source/control-plane-lite-source-writekey.png" alt="Control plane lite source write Key" />

### Step 2: Sending test events

To send the test events, follow the steps listed in the sections below depending on your preferred setup choice:

### For local setup

1. Navigate to the folder where RudderStack is installed.
2. Then, run the following command after replacing `<WRITE_KEY>` with the source write key obtained in the previous section, and `<DATA_PLANE_URL>` with your <Link to="/dashboard-guides/overview/#data-plane-url">data plane URL</Link>.

```bash
./scripts/generate-event <WRITE_KEY> <DATA_PLANE_URL>/v1/batch
```
An example is shown below:

<img src="../../assets/rudderstack-open-source/test-event.png" alt="Test Event" />

### For Docker setup

For a Dockerized setup, run the following command:
  
```bash
docker exec -ti \
    <rudder-server-running-container-id> \
    ./scripts/generate-event <WRITE_KEY> <DATA_PLANE_URL>/v1/batch
```

You can then check your destination to verify that the events are delivered.

<div class="infoBlock">
Note that unlike RudderStack Open Source, the control plane set up using the <Link to="/tmp-get-started/rudderstack-open-source/control-plane-lite/">Control Plane Lite</Link> utility does not let you view live events.
</div>

If you supply an invalid source write key or data plane URL, you will get the following error:

<img src="../../assets/rudderstack-open-source/test-event-error.png" alt="Test Event error" />

## Using the HTTP API

To send test events via the <Link to="/api/http-api/">RudderStack HTTP API</Link>, follow these steps:

1. Import this [Postman collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/480307c55ad2b9dd4e27). 
2. Edit the variables `source_write_key` and `data_plane_url` in this collection with your source write key and your <Link to="/dashboard-guides/overview/#data-plane-url">data plane URL</Link>.

RudderStack uses **Basic Authentication** for authenticating all the HTTP requests. The HTTP Basic Authentication requires a user name and password where:
  - The user name is the `source_write_key`
  - The password is an empty string (`""`)

Now you can send test API requests and verify if your installation is working as expected.
