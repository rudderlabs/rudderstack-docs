  Step-by-step guide to ingest data from your Facebook Ads account into
  RudderStack.
---

[Facebook Ads](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads) is an online advertising platform that lets you create and run cross-device marketing campaigns, and track their performance with easy to read reports. With Facebook Ads, you can create, publish and purchase ads across all Facebook platforms - including Facebook, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, and Audience Network.

This document guides you in setting up Facebook Ads as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Facebook Ads data, which can then be routed to your data warehouse destination supported by RudderStack.

If you have already connected RudderStack to your Facebook Ads account, your credentials should appear automatically under **Use existing credentials**.

</div>

### Configuring the Source

- In the next screen, choose the **Page** from where you want RudderStack to import the data. Also, select the **Historical data** as well as the **Attribution window** timeframe, and click on **Next**.
  - **Historical Data** - this sets the range for the first sync, and can be used to fetch the historical pull
  - **Attribution window** - this sets the date range for any subsequent sync

  alt="Attribution Window"
/>

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack will not sync the data which is older than the selected timeframes.

</div>

### Setting the Data Update Schedule

- Next, you will be required to set the **Run Frequency** to schedule the data import from your Facebook Ads account to RudderStack. You can also specify the time when you want this synchronization to start, by choosing the time under the **Sync Starting At** option.

### Specifying the Data to Import

- Finally, select the data from the Facebook Ads page that you want RudderStack to import. You can choose to import data from select columns, or import all the data by clicking on **Select All**. Then, click on **Next**.

<!--<img src="../assets/screen-shot-2021-02-08-at-1.24.13-pm.png" />-->

<img

  alt="Import Data"
/>

That's it! Facebook Ads is now successfully configured as a source on your RudderStack dashboard.

RudderStack will start importing data from Facebook Ads as per the specified frequency. You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Connect Destinations** or **Add Destinations**, as shown:

## FAQs

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

We have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
