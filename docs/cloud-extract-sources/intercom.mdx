# Intercom

[Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) is an industry-leading, real-time business messaging platform, that allows you to bring together and manage all your customer life cycle activities on a single platform.

This document guides you in setting up Intercom as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Intercom data, which can then be routed to your data warehouse destination supported by RudderStack.

**All the Cloud Extract sources support sending data only to a data warehouse destination.**

## Getting Started

To set up Intercom as a source on the RudderStack dashboard, follow these steps:

- Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderlabs.com/signup?type=freetrial).
- From the left panel, select **Sources**. Then, click on **Add Source**, as shown:

<!--<img src="../assets/1 (4) (3) (3) (3) (3) (3) (3) (3) (3) (3) (3) (3) (3) (3) (3) (3) (2) (1).png" />-->

<img

  alt="Add Source"
/>

- Next, select **Intercom** from the list of **Cloud Sources**, and click on **Next**.

### Specifying Connection Credentials

- Next, authenticate RudderStack with Intercom by clicking on the Connect with Intercom option, as shown:

<!--<img src="../assets/4 (10).png" />-->

  alt="Authenticate RudderStack with Intercom"
/>

<div class="infoBlock">

If you've already configured Intercom as a source before, you can choose the account visible under the **Use existing credentials** tab.

</div>

### Setting the Data Update Schedule

- Next, you will be required to set the **Run Frequency** to schedule the data import from your Intercom account to RudderStack. You can also specify the time when you want this synchronization to start, by choosing the time under the **Sync Starting At** option.

### Selecting the Data to Import

- Finally, choose the Intercom data that you wish to ingest via RudderStack. You can either select all the data, or choose specific Intercom data attributes, as per your requirement.

<!--<img src="../assets/6 (12).png" />-->

<img src="../assets/6 (12).png" alt="Choose Intercom data" />

That's it! Intercom is now successfully configured as a source on your RudderStack dashboard.

RudderStack will start ingesting data from Intercom as per the specified frequency. You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Connect Destinations** or **Add Destination**, as shown:

<!--<img src="../assets/7 (7).png" />-->

<img src="../assets/7 (7).png" alt="Connect Destinations" />

<div class="successBlock">

  Use the **Connect Destinations** option if you have already
  configured a data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data
  warehouse destination from scratch, click on the
  **Add Destination** button.

## FAQs

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

We have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
