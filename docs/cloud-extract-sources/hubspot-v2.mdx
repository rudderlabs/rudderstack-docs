# HubSpot v2

[HubSpot](https://www.HubSpot.com/) is a leading marketing and CRM platform that helps you track leads as well as inbound marketing and sales.

This document guides you in setting up HubSpot as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified HubSpot data and routes it to your data warehouse.

## Getting started

To set up HubSpot as a source in RudderStack, follow these steps:

1. Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).
2. Go to **Sources** > **New source** > **Cloud Extract** and select **HubSpot** from the list of sources.
3. Assign a name to your source and click on **Continue**.

### Connection settings

<div class="infoBlock">

Your HubSpot account and the related details will then automatically appear under <strong>Choose an account</strong>.
</div>

* **Start Date**: Select the date from when RudderStack should ingest your HubSpot data.

<div class="warningBlock">

RudderStack will not replicate any data before this date.
</div>

### Destination settings

The following settings specify how RudderStack sends the ingested data from HubSpot to the warehouse destination:

- **Table prefix**: RudderStack uses this prefix to create a table in your data warehouse and loads all your HubSpot data into it.
- **Schedule Settings**: RudderStack gives you three options to ingest the data from HubSpot:
    - **Basic**: Runs the syncs at the specified time interval. 
    - **CRON**: Runs the syncs based on the user-defined CRON expression.
    - **Manual**: You are required to run the syncs manually.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the schedule types, refer to the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/cloud-extract-sources/common-settings/">Common Settings</a> guide.
</div>

### Selecting the data to import

HubSpot is now configured as a source. RudderStack will start ingesting data from HubSpot as per your specified schedule and frequency.

You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Add Destination**, as shown:

<div class="successBlock">

Use the <strong>Use Existing Destination</strong> option if you have an already-configured data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data warehouse destination from scratch, select the <strong>Create New Destination</strong> button.

## FAQ

### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
