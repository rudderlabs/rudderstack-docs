## Getting started

Before configuring Split.io as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Split.io by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | -             | -             | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, read the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</a> guide.

2. Assign a name to the destination and click on **Next**.

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript

  name: "Alex Keener",
  email: "alex@example.com",
  plan: "GOLD",
  age: 40,

</div>

## Track

A sample `track` call is shown below:
