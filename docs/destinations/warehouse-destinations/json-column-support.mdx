description: >-
  Detailed technical description of the JSON column feature supported by the warehouse destinations.
---

With JSON column support, you can now ingest semi-structured event data not defined by a fixed schema. Also, you can directly store a nested event payload without worrying about the length limit in your warehouse columns.

<div class="infoBlock">
The JSON column feature is supported by the following warehouse destinations:
<ul>
  <li><Link to="/destinations/warehouse-destinations/redshift/">Amazon Redshift</Link></li>
  <li><Link to="/destinations/warehouse-destinations/bigquery/">Google BigQuery</Link></li>
  <li><Link to="/destinations/warehouse-destinations/postgresql/">PostgreSQL</Link></li>
  <li><Link to="/destinations/warehouse-destinations/snowflake/">Snowflake</Link></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="warningBlock">
This feature is applicable only for the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track/"><code class="inline-code">track</code></Link> events.
</div>

## Using the JSON column feature

You can use the JSON column feature using any of the following approaches:

### Declaring JSON columns at the event level

You can use the SDK's `integrations: options` parameter to specify the JSON columns at the event level. The following example demonstrates the use of the <Link to="/sources/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/#integrationopts">JavaScript SDK's</Link> `IntegrationOpts` parameter to declare the JSON columns:

```javascript
"integrations": {
  "All": true,
  "RS": {
    "options": {
      "jsonPaths": ["testArray", "testMap.nestedMap"]
    }
  }
```

Here, `nestedMap` is declared as a JSON column and is in the following format:

```javascript
{
  "testMap": {
    "nestedMap": {
      ...
    }
  }
}
// To declare nestedMap as a JSON column, add "testMap.nestedMap" in the above list.

```
<div class="infoBlock">
Make sure you configure the SDK to load the <code class="inline-code">options</code> parameter by default. Refer to the following SDK guides for more context:
<ul>
  <li><Link to="/sources/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/#the-options-parameter">JavaScript</Link></li>
  <li><Link to="/sources/sdks/rudderstack-android-sdk/#1-passing-destinations-while-initializing-the-sdk">Android</Link></li>
  <li><Link to="/sources/sdks/rudderstack-ios-sdk/#1-passing-destinations-while-initializing-the-sdk">iOS</Link></li>
</ul>
Then, include the column path from the event payload in the <code class="inline-code">destination_type.options.jsonPaths</code> list, as seen in the above code snippet.
</div>

### User transformations

You can also declare the JSON columns using a custom transformation, as shown:

```javascript
export function transformEvent(event, metadata) {
  const meta = metadata(event);
  if (event.event === 'product_clicked' && meta.sourceId === "source_id" && meta.destinationType === "RS") { // ex: BQ, POSTGRES, SNOWFLAKE
    if (!event.integrations) event.integrations = {};
    event.integrations["RS"] = {
      options: {
        jsonPaths: ["testArray", "testMap.nestedMap"]
      }
    }
  }
  return event;
}
```

The above transformation applies the JSON column to only `product_clicked` type of `track` events coming from a particular `sourceId`.

<div class="infoBlock">
The JSON columns declared at the <Link to="#declaring-json-columns-at-the-event-level">event level</Link> can be overridden by the JSON columns declared using a custom transformation.
</div>

### Declaring JSON columns during destination configuration

While configuring your warehouse destination settings in RudderStack, you can pass the required JSON column paths using the dot notation and separated by a comma in the **JSON columns** field as shown:

<img src="../../assets/dw-integrations/json-column-dashboard-setting.png" alt="JSON column setting in RudderStack dashboard" />

<div class="infoBlock">
This option applies to all the <code class="inline-code">track</code> events sent to the warehouse destination.
</div>

## Semi-structured data usage and limitations

For warehouse-specific information on working with semi-structured data and the associated limitations, refer to the following guides:

| Warehouse | Data type | Reference |
| :-----------| :----------| :----------|
| Redshift | SUPER | [Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_SUPER_type.html) |
| BigQuery | STRING <br /><br />(More information on how RudderStack treats the JSON columns as strings in this <Link to="#how-can-i-use-the-json-column-feature-in-bigquery">FAQ</Link>) | [Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/json_functions) |
| PostgreSQL | JSONB | [Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html) |
| Snowflake | VARIANT | [Documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/data-types-semistructured.html#variant) |

## FAQ

### Which events are supported in this feature?

The JSON column feature supports only [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/track/) events.

### Which data types are supported in this feature?

The JSON data type includes String, Integers, Float, Arrays, Booleans, and Maps.

### How can I use the JSON column feature in BigQuery?

Google BigQuery has released JSON support only as a preview feature. Hence, RudderStack will treat the JSON columns as strings and insert the JSON strings as the values. You can use the JSON functions to query the semi-structured data.

For more information, refer to the [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/json_functions).

### How does RudderStack determine the column data type? Can I change an existing data type for a column?

RudderStack determines the data type of a column based on its value in the first event (during the first upload sync).

For example, suppose `column_x` is received with the value as `1`. RudderStack then sets the data type of this column as `int` in the event table.

<div class="infoBlock">
Although you can change the columns' data type in the warehouse any time, the changes will be applicable to the events from the next sync.
</div>

To set your preferred data type for a particular column, it is highly recommended to follow these steps:

1. Create a column in the warehouse with a dummy name and the required data type.
2. Cast the data from the original column and load it into the dummy column.
3. Drop the original column.
4. Rename the dummy column to the original column name.

<div class="warningBlock">
During steps 3 and 4, the tables will be in a locked state. This might impact real-time data uploads/syncs.
If the above steps take too long to complete, you can halt the warehouse operations in the interim. For more information, refer to this <Link to="/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/#how-do-i-avoid-lags-in-data-syncs-while-heavy-loads-are-running-on-my-data-warehouse">FAQ</Link>.
