RudderStack supports integration with all the leading data warehouses. Now you can set up these warehouses as destinations in RudderStack and send all your event data from your preferred sources.

## Supported warehouse destinations

## Warehouse schema

When sending your events to a data warehouse via RudderStack, you don't need to define a schema for your event data - RudderStack automatically does that for you by following a predefined <Link to="/destinations/warehouse-destinations/warehouse-schema/">warehouse schema</Link>.
