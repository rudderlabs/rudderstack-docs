# Pinterest Tag

[Pinterest Ads Tag](https://ads.pinterest.com/) is a piece of code that, when added to your website, allows Pinterest to track your visitors as well as their actions. It gives you a detailed conversion report related to any and all customer activities like signups or buying a product.

RudderStack supports Pinterest as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your event data, through Pinterest's `pintrk` conversion tag.

<div class="infoBlock">

Find the open source transformer code for this destination in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-js/tree/production/integrations/PinterestTag).

</div>

## Getting started

Before configuring Pinterest Tag as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by New Relic by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :----- | :----- |
| **Device Mode**     | **Supported** | **-**  | **-**  |
| **Cloud Mode**      | **-**         | **-**  | **-**  |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <Link to="/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack connection modes</Link> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Pinterest Tag, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Pinterest Tag**.
2. Assign a name to the destination and click on **Continue**.

### Connection settings

To successfully configure Pinterest Tag as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/pinterest_tag.png" />

- **Pinterest Tag ID**: Enter your Pinterest Tag ID.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on finding the Pinterest Tag ID, refer to the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section below.
</div>

- **Custom Properties**: You can use this field to add any custom properties which should be sent to Pinterest.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on using the custom properties, refer to the <a href="#custom-properties">Custom properties</a> section below.
</div>

- **Map Your Events To Pinterest Events**: You can use this field to map your event to a specific Pinterest event.
- **Use device-mode to send events**: As this is a device mode-only destination, this setting is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.

### Enable Enhanced Match 

Enable this setting to support Pinterest Enhanced Match. Rudderstack supports it when the following two scenarios are met:
  - Where a user is identified every time they visit your site.
  - When a user visits your site anonymously but is identified at some later stage by making an `identify()` call.

### Enable Enhanced Match on Page Load

When enabled, this configuration will attach the hashed email address on the initial page load. Now any call made to Pinterest will be an Enhanced Match.

If this setting is not enabled, all the visits made to your site will be anonymous. But you can still identify any user by making the `identify()` call.

If you use Rudderstack's `identify()` method to enable Pinterest’s Enhanced Match, you can only collect this information for successive events. Pinterest does not update the values for the past events retroactively.

## Identify

The <Link to="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/identify/">`identify`</Link> call lets you create new or update existing customers and record the traits about them like their name, email address, etc. 

When you make an `identify` call with a user’s email address and traits, RudderStack triggers the Pinterest `set()` method. This saves the identification parameters to be sent with the next events, so it is recommended to set the values as early as possible. If you make an `identify` call without `email`, the identification parameter will not be set.

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm", {
  name: "Alex Keener",
  email: "alex@example.com",
})
```

In the above example, the identification parameter will be set to `alex@example.com` and the successive calls will be an Enhanced Match.

<div class="infoBlock">

Nothing appears in the network tab in your browser or in the tag helper extension after <code class="inline-code">identify()</code> is called. However, a hashed value for an <code class="inline-code">em</code> parameter is added in the next event call, in a JSON object encoded in the URL.

</div>

## Track

The <Link to="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/track/">`track`</Link> call allows you to capture user actions along with the properties associated with these actions.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Order Completed")
```

RudderStack SDK sends the `track` event name and any properties as custom properties to Pinterest.

## Page

The <Link to="/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/page">`page`</Link> call lets you record your website's page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.

Pinterest's `pintrk` conversion tag sends any one of the following events when you make a `page` call:

- **`ViewCategory`**: RudderStack sends this event if both the `name` and `category` fields are present. The below sample event contains both and is mapped to Pinterest's `ViewCategory` event:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page("Best Seller", "Games", {
  path: "/best-seller/games/1",
  url: "https://www.estore.com/best-seller/games/1",
  title: "Best selling games offered by EStore",
  search: "estore bestseller games",
  referrer: "https://www.google.com/search?q=estore+bestseller",
  testDimension: "true",
})
```
- **`PageVisit`**: RudderStack sends this event if only `name` field is present. Any additional properties are dropped. The below sample event contains only `name` and is mapped to Pinterest's `PageVisit` event:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page("Best Seller", {
  path: "/best-seller/1",
})
```

## E-Commerce

RudderStack supports E-Commerce conversion tracking for Pinterest. You can use the <Link to="/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-ecommerce-events-specification/">RudderStack e-commerce specification</Link> for sending the events while instrumenting your site with the RudderStack SDK.

The following table mentions sample `track` events passed to the Pinterest events:

| RudderStack event | Pinterest event  |
| :--------------------- | :------------------- |
| Order Completed        | `Checkout`           |
| Product Added          | `AddToCart`          |
| Products Searched      | `Search`             |
| Product List Filtered    | `Search`           |

You can also track a custom event that you want to include in your conversion reporting. This will get mapped to a custom Pinterest event. An example is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("custom")
```
<div class="infoBlock">
  
You can map your event to a specific Pinterest event by adding it in the <strong>Map Your Events To Pinterest Events</strong> section while configuring the Pinterest destination in RudderStack.
</div>

### Standard Pinterest events

Pinterest supports the following nine standard events that can be mapped and tracked for reporting:

- `Checkout`
- `AddToCart`
- `PageVisit`
- `SignUp`
- `WatchVideo`
- `Lead`
- `Search`
- `ViewCategory`
- `Custom`

<div class="infoBlock">

These events aren’t available for conversion reporting.
</div>

Pinterest treats any event apart from the above as a user-defined event.

### Property mapping

Rudderstack maps the following properties to the Pinterest properties:

| RudderStack property | Pinterest property |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------- |
| query                     | `search_query`          |
| value                     | `value`                 |
| order_quantity            | `order_quantity`        |
| currency                  | `currency`              |
| order_id                  | `order_id`              |
| promo_code                | `promo_code`            |
| property                  | `property`              |
| video_title               | `video_title`           |
| lead_type                 | `lead_type`             |
| coupon                    | `coupon`                |

The following properties are nested within the e-commerce `products` array:

| RudderStack property  | Pinterest property  |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------- |
| product_id                | `product_id`            |
| sku                       | `product_id`            |
| name                      | `product_name`          |
| price                     | `product_price`         |
| category                  | `product_category`      |
| variant                   | `product_variant`       |
| quantity                  | `product_quantity`      |
| brand                     | `product_brand`         |

### Custom properties

You can send the custom properties to Pinterest by adding them in the **Custom Properties** section while configuring the Pinterest destination in RudderStack.

A sample snippet to send custom properties is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Event", {
  customProperty: {
    customValue: 2,
  },
  someRandomMailId: "user@gmail.com",
})
```

You need to add the following properties in **Custom Properties** section to send them to Pinterest:
- `customProperty.customValue`
- `someRandomMailId`
