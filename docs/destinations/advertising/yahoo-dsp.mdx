## `audiencelist` event structure

The following code snippet shows a sample `audienceList` call:

```json
{
    "type": "audiencelist",
    "properties": {
        "listData": {
            "add": [{
                    "email": 'alex@example.com'
                },
                {
                    "email": 'john@example.com'
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

For deviceId, email can be replaced with deviceId and for IP Address with ipAddress
Only add is supported, not remove
