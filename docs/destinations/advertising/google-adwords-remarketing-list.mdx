description: Step-by-step guide to send event data from RudderStack to Google Adwords Remarketing Lists.
---

[Google Adwords Remarketing Lists](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6276125?hl=en) lets you send a list of users (audience list) to Google Adwords and run targeted advertising campaigns without having to update the user list manually.

RudderStack supports Google Adwords Remarketing Lists as a destination to which you can send your audience list.

<div class="dangerBlock">
This destination is <strong>temporarily</strong> rate-limited and there is a possibility your events might not flow through. The RudderStack team is actively working on a fix for this issue. For any questions, <a href="mailto:%20support@rudderstack.com">contact us</a> or start a conversation in our <a href="https://rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack-community">Slack</a> community.
</div>

## Getting started

Before configuring Google Adwords Remarketing Lists as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**         | **Mobile**   | **Server**        |
| :-------------------| :-------------- | :----------- | :-----------------|
| **Device mode**     | -               | -            | -                 |
| **Cloud mode**      | -               | -            |  **Supported**    |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</a> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Google Adwords Remarketing Lists, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Google Adwords Remarketing Lists (Customer Match)**.
2. Assign a name to your destination and click on **Next**.

### Connection settings

To successfully configure Google Adwords Remarketing Lists as a destination, follow the steps below:

1. Give RudderStack access to your Google Ads account by clicking on **Connect with Google Ads Remarketing Lists (Customer Match)** under **Create new account**.
2. Then, you will need to configure the following settings:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/google-adwords-remarketing-lists-connection-settings.png" alt="Google Adwords Remarketing Lists (Customer Match) connection settings" />

- **ListId**: To get your Google Ads list ID, go to your Google Ads account and navigate to **Tools & settings** > **Audience Manager**.
- **Customer ID**: Enter the ID associated with your Google Ads account. You can find it by clicking on the **Help** option in your dashboard.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on obtaining the customer ID, refer to the <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1704344?hl=en">Google Ads Help Center</a> page.
</div>

- **Subaccount**: Enable this setting if you are using a Google Ads subaccount.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on subaccounts, refer to the <a href="https://support.google.com/campaignmanager/answer/2829448?hl=en#zippy=%2Cwhat-are-subaccounts">Google Ads Help Center</a> page.
</div>

- **Login-customer-ID**: Enter the customer ID of the parent account (associated with the subaccount).

<div class="infoBlock">

This field is required only when you want to send data to a customer list of a subaccount.
</div>

- **Type of List**: Select the type of list you want to create.

<div class="infoBlock">

You can create three types of list via this setting:
<ul>
<li><strong>General</strong>: You can send email, phone number, and address information in this list. RudderStack will hash this data and send it to Google Adwords Remarketing Lists depending on the <strong>Hash Required</strong> setting (enabled by default).</li>
<li><strong>UserId</strong>: You can send third party user IDs in this list.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Device ID</strong>: You can send mobile device IDs in this list.</li>
</ul>
</div>

- **Hash Required**: This setting is enabled by default and hashes the `email`, `phone`, `firstName`, and `lastName` fields in the SHA-256 format.
- **Schema Fields**: If you have selected **General** as the list type, you will need to choose your schema fields (at least one) from the available options. The options are `hashedEmail`, `hashedPhoneNumber`, and `addressInfo`.

<div class="warningBlock">

RudderStack expects the user events to consist of all the schema fields listed here.
</div>

## `audiencelist` event structure

<div class="infoBlock">

The Google Adwords Remarketing Lists destination supports only <code class="inline-code">audiencelist</code> calls. You can send up to 100000 user records in one call.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack supports both additions and deletions to a user list.
</div>

The following code snippet shows a sample `audienceList` call:

```json
{
  "userId": "user1",
  "anonymousId": "anon-id-new",
  "event": "event1",
  "type": "audiencelist",
  "properties": {
    "listData": {

For more information on the access level permissions, refer to this [Google Ads support page](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9978556?visit_id=637611563637058259-4176462731&rd=1).
