description: Step-by-step guide to set up Redis as a destination in RudderStack.
---

Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store, which can be used as a database, and a message broker.

RudderStack stores all the traits of your user as a [Redis hash](https://redis.io/commands/hset), allowing you to access user profiles in real-time.

<div class="infoBlock">

Redis destination only processes **`identify`** API calls. Other event types are ignored.

</div>

<div class="warningBlock">

It is highly recommended that you keep your Redis instance inside a private network and make it accessible to RudderStack.

  **Find the open-source transformer code for this destination in our <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/v0/destinations/redis">GitHub repo</a>.**
</div>

## Getting Started

- Select the destination as **Redis** to your source. Give your destination a name and then click on **Next**.
- Next, in the **Connection Settings**, fill all the fields with the relevant information and click on **Next**.

**Prefix**
By default, RudderStack stores user traits with the key `user:<user_id>`. An extra prefix can be added in the destination configuration to distinguish all RudderStack-stored keys with a prefix.

**Database**
RudderStack stores the user traits in the default database of the Redis instance. A different database inside the Redis instance can be configured from the destination configuration.

**Secure**
Switch this on to enable secure TLS communication between RudderStack redis client and your redis server

**Skip Verify**
Switch this on to skip the client's verification of the server's certificate chain and host name. In this mode, TLS is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. This should be used only for testing.

**CA certificate**
Certificate which needs to be verified while establishing a secure connection. Skip setting this if Root CA of your server can be verified with any client eg. Elasticache

## Identify

The **`identify`** call lets you associate the actions to a user and record their traits like name, email, etc.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the **`identify`** method, please refer to our <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api">RudderStack API Specification</a> guide.

</div>

RudderStack stores the user traits in the configured Redis instance. You can access the latest user traits by querying Redis for the key `user:<user_id>`.

Here is an example of an **`identify`** event with traits from [RudderStack JavaScript SDK](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-javascript-sdk) and how it is stored in Redis.

```javascript
// Identify a user with name and title as traits

rudderanalytics.identify("user-1", {
  name: "John Doe",
  title: "CEO",
})
```

```bash
// redis-cli
redis> HGETALL user:user-1
1) "name"
2) "John Doe"
3) "title"
4) "CEO"
```

**Nested Properties**
If your user traits have nested properties, they will be flattened out with `.` as the separator.

```javascript
// Identify a user with location as a trait

rudderanalytics.identify("user-2", {
  location: {
    state: "Texas",
    city: "Austin",
  },
})
```

```bash
// redis-cli
redis> HGETALL user:user-2
1) "location.state"
2) "Texas"
3) "location.city"
4) "Austin"
```

**Custom Prefix**
If you configure a Redis destination with a prefix `rudderstack`, then all the keys will be prefixed in the same manner.

Here's an example of how it works:

```javascript
// Identify a user with name and title as traits

rudderanalytics.identify("user-3", {
  age: 23,
})
```

```bash
// redis-cli
redis> HGETALL rudderstack:user:user-3
1) "age"
2) 23
```

## FAQ's

### How to setup redis on docker with TLS support?

One way to enable a TLS endpoint for accessing redis is to run a `redis-stunnel` container with a link to the `redis` container and exposing the TLS port. More instructions can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/runnable/redis-stunnel/)

<div class="infoBlock">

Set Common Name to `localhost` while generating CA certificate and server certificates

</div>

Set the TLS endpoint of the `redis-stunnel` container as the address in the RudderStack Redis destination settings. Eg. `127.0.0.1:6380` while running containers locally with defaults. Set the `ca.pem` file generated above as the CA certificate in the settings
