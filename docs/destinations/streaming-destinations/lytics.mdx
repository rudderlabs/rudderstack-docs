## Identify

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify">`identify`</Link> call captures the relevant details about the visiting user.

A sample `identify` payload is as shown in the snippet below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("1hKOm4GRlm", {
  name: "Alex Keener",
  email: "alex@example.com",
})
```

## Page

With the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/page">`page`</Link> method, RudderStack makes a call to Lytics to record a page view.

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page("Popular", "Bestseller", {
  url: "https://www.estore.com/search/best-seller/1",
  path: "/best-seller/1",

A sample screen call is as shown:

```objectivec
[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@"Home"];
```

rudderanalytics.track("Order Completed", {
  order_id: "1a2b3c4d",
  category: "category",
