Find the open source transformer code for this destination in the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/delighted">GitHub repository</a>.
</div>

## Getting started

Before configuring your source and destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Delighted by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | -             | -             | -             |
| **Cloud** **mode**  | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">
To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</Link> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source supports sending events to Delighted, follow these steps:

- From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **Delighted**.
- Give a name to the destination and click on **Next**. You should then see the following screen:

- Enter your Delighted **API Key**.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on how to get your Delighted API key, refer to the Delighted <a href="https://app.delighted.com/docs/api">docs</a>.

</div>

- By default, the channel is set to **Email**. You can also select **SMS** from the dropdown.
- Set the **Delay** value \(in seconds\) here. By default it is set to **0**.
- To make a `track` call, enter the **Event Names** for which `track` call will be triggered.

<div class="warningBlock">

If the RudderStack dashboard does not contain the **Event** for which the <code class="inline-code">track</code> call is triggered, RudderStack will throw an error.

</div>

- Finally, click on **Next**. Delighted will now be enabled as a destination in Rudderstack.

## Identify

The `identify` call lets you to add a user to your **People** [**List**](https://app.delighted.com/people). If the user already exists, RudderStack will update the user with the latest information. This includes `userId` as well as other additional properties related to user like name,phone number/email, channel, and the 'Last sent at' timestamp.

- The `userId` provided during the call must match the **Channel** type. The channel type can be either set from Rudderstack dashboard or you can send it via the `identify` call with the parameter `DelightedChannelType`.

<div class="infoBlock">

The channel type set via the <code class="inline-code">identify</code> call will get a higher precedence.

</div>

- You can provide the user email or phone number. Both are not required at the same time, since one of the values will be set from the `userId`.
- You can also send the `last_sent_at` value with the call. Refer to the example below for more details.

<div class="infoBlock">

<code class="inline-code">Last sent at</code> (in UNIX timestamp) is used to manually set the time a person was most recently sent a survey. This value will be used in the Delighted **Survey throttling** system, which ensures that same person wonâ€™t be surveyed more than once per month.

To change its value manually, go the Delighted <a href="https://app.delighted.com/dashboard">dashboard</a>, select your **Project** from top left corner and click on the settings icon beside **Project Name**.

</div>

A sample `identify` call is as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("name@surname.com", {
  name: "User",
  last_sent_at: "1624293839",
  phone_number: "+1234567890"},
  { externalId: [
    {
        type: "delightedChannelType",
        id: "sms"
    }
  ]}
});
```

In this example, since the `userId` is already an email, you can provide the user's `phone_number` as well. Also, the `delightedChannelType` will override the **Channel Type** set in the RudderStack dashboard.

<div class="infoBlock">

Except <code class="inline-code">userId</code>, all the other fields in the call are optional.

</div>

## Track

The `track` call lets you send the survey to the user added to the **People** [**List**](https://app.delighted.com/people) in your account. In addition to name, phone number/email,channel, and the 'Last sent at' timestamp, you can also add as many custom properties as you need.

<div class="warningBlock">

If the user does not exist, you cannot make a <code class="inline-code">track</code> call. You need to first add the user in the People list via the <code class="inline-code">identify</code> call.

</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

The **Delay** value from the dashboard will override the value sent via the <code class="inline-code">track</code> call.

</div>

A sample `track` call is as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Test", {
  delighted_email_subject: "Custom Email Subject.",
  customProperty: "Custom Value",
  customProperty2: "Custom Value2"},
  { externalId: [
    {
        type: "delightedChannelType",
        id: "sms"
    }
  ]}
});
```

In the above example, `Test` is the event name. Except the event name, all other fields are optional.

<div class="warningBlock">

If you do not enter the **Event** name in the dashboard for which the <code class="inline-code">track</code> call is triggered, RudderStack will throw an error.

</div>

Delighted also provides some custom properties by itself. In the above example, `delighted_email_subject` sets the email subject of the survey to `Custom Email Subject`. Note that this change can be done from the [**Delighted website**](https://app.delighted.com/platforms) too.

Some other default properties provided by Delighted are mentioned in the table below:

| **Delighted Property**    | **Description**                                                                            |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `question_product_name`   | Delighted shows this question in the survey.                                               |
| `delighted_intro_message` | Delighted displays this message in the email subject.                                      |
| `locale`                  | This property determines the localization \(including language\) of the survey experience. |

For more default properties, check out this Delighted [**support page**](https://help.delighted.com/article/577-special-properties).

In the example shown above, `customProperty` is the custom property field that you can set. Note that you must provide values for these custom fields, or else they will be dropped by Delighted.

## Alias

The `alias` call allows you to update the user's email or phone number. You need to set `previousId` as the current value and `userId` as the updated value.

<div class="infoBlock">

The <code class="inline-code">previousId</code> and <code class="inline-code">userId</code> must be of the same type, i.e., either email or phone number.

</div>

A sample `alias` call is as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.alias("new@email.com", "old@email.com")
```

<div class="infoBlock">

Both <code class="inline-code">previousId</code> and <code class="inline-code">userId</code> are required.

</div>
