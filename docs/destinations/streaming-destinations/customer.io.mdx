description: Step-by-step guide on sending your event data from RudderStack to Customer.io
---

[Customer.io](https://customer.io/) is a popular platform for sending automated messages and emails to your customers, with a focus on security and privacy. With Customer.io, you get complete information about your customers in one place, and use it to create personalized messages and campaigns for them.

RudderStack supports Customer.io as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your event data.

<div class="infoBlock">
Find the open source transformer code for this destination in the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/v0/destinations/customerio">GitHub repository</a>.
</div>

## Getting started

RudderStack supports sending event data to Customer.io via the following <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">connection modes</a>:

| Connection Mode | Web      | Mobile    | Server   |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | **Supported** | -             | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">
In the web device mode integration, that is, using <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk">JavaScript SDK</Link> as a source, the Customer.io native SDK is loaded from <code class="inline-code">https://assets.customer.io/</code> domain. Based on your website's content security policy, you might need to <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain">allowlist this domain</Link> to load the Customer.io SDK successfully.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the platform supports sending events to Customer.io, follow these steps:

1. From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **Customer.io**.
2. Assign a name to the destination and click on **Continue**. You should then see the following screen:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/customerio-connection-settings.png" alt="Customer.io connection settings" />

### Connection settings

The connection settings required to configure Customer.io as a destination in RudderStack are listed below:

- **Site ID**: Enter your Customer.io site ID.
- **API Key**: Enter your Customer.io API key. 

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on obtaining your Customer.io site ID and API key, refer to the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section below.
</div>

- **Event sent after setting device token**: Enter the name of the event that is fired immediately after setting the device token.
- **Account based in the EU data center?**: Enable this option in case your account is based in the EU region.

<div class="infoBlock">
Refer to the <a href="https://customer.io/docs/api/?region=eu#section/Overview">Customer.io documentation</a> for more information on this setting.
</div>

#### Web device mode settings

- **Use native SDK to send events**: Enable this setting to send the events through Customer.io's native JavaScript SDK.
- **OneTrust Cookie Category**: Specify the OneTrust category name for mapping the OneTrust consent settings to RudderStack's consent purposes.

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on this setting, refer to the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/onetrust-consent-manager/">OneTrust Consent Manager</Link> guide.
</div>

Finally, click on **Next** to complete the setup. Customer.io will now be enabled as a destination in RudderStack.

## Identify

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify">`identify`</Link> call sends the event data to Customer.io along with the properties that you pass as the RudderStack traits.

<div class="infoBlock">
<code class="inline-code">userId</code> is a mandatory field for Customer.io. If it is not provided, RudderStack uses <code class="inline-code">anonymousId</code> instead.
</div>

RudderStack also sends the `createdAt` field as `created_at` to Customer.io to register the user signup time.

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("userId", {
  name: "Tintin",
  city: "Brussels",
  country: "Belgium",
  email: "tintin@herge.com"
});
```

As `createdAt` is not present in the above call, RudderStack will append the current timestamp value and send the field to Customer.io.

<div class="infoBlock">
The same <code class="inline-code">email</code> cannot be used to make consecutive <code class="inline-code">identify</code> calls with different <code class="inline-code">userId</code>.
</div>

### Unsubscribing users

You can pass `unsubscribed: true` in the `identify` call to unsubscribe a user in Customer.io, as shown in the following snippet:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("userId", {
  email: "tintin@herge.com",
  unsubscribed: true
});
```

<div class="infoBlock">
 Make sure the user ID and the email values match the Customer.io attributes. You can verify this by selecting that user in the <a href="https://customer.io/docs/getting-started-people/">People</a> page in your Customer.io dashboard and clicking on <strong>Attributes</strong>.
</div>

## Page

If you are using a native SDK, the Customer.io JavaScript snippet is loaded and captures the page view automatically. You can also call `rudderanalytics.page()` that sends the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/page">`page`</Link> event along with any associated properties that you want to pass along with the call.

A sample `page` call is as shown below:

```javascript
// "home" is the name of the page.
rudderanalytics.page("home", {
  path: "path",
  url: "url",
  title: "title",
  search: "search",
  referrer: "referrer",
});
```

## Screen

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/screen">`screen`</Link> call lets you record whenever your user views their mobile screen, with any additional relevant information about the screen. 

If you have turned on the screen views in your app implementation from the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-ios-sdk/">iOS</Link> or <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-android-sdk/">Android</Link> SDK, they will be registered as `Viewed <screen_name> Screen` under the **Activities** tab for the user. 

RudderStack will also forward the event properties passed along with the `screen` call to Customer.io as they are received.

A sample `screen` call using RudderStack's iOS SDK is shown below:

```objectivec
[[RudderClient sharedInstance] screen:@"Main"
            properties:@{@"prop_key" : @"prop_value"}];
```

The above event will be transformed as `Viewed Main Screen` and sent to Customer.io.

## Track

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track">`track`</Link> call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.

A sample `track` call is as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Track me", {
  category: "category",
  label: "label",
  value: "value",
});
```

<div class="warningBlock">
For anonymous users, Customer.io does not allow an event name of size more than 100 Bytes. RudderStack will automatically trim the event names in such a scenario.
</div>

## Alias

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/alias">`alias`</Link>Â call lets you merge different identities of a known user. RudderStack merges the attributes of both the user identities by retaining the attributes of the primary identity and merging the additional attributes of the secondary identity.

A sample `alias` call is as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.alias("test_new_id", "old_user_id");
```

<div class="warningBlock">
The <code class="inline-code">alias</code> call is applicable only when both the users are present in Customer.io.
</div>

## Device token registration

RudderStack registers the device token to Customer.io for the following application lifecycle events:

- `Application Installed`
- `Application Opened`

To use this feature, enable the <code class="inline-code">trackApplicationLifecycleEvents</code> feature in your mobile SDK implementation code. Also, you need to register your device token after initializing the SDK. 

The following snippets demonstrate registering the device token for iOS and Android:

<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>iOS</Tab>
    <Tab>Android</Tab>
  </TabList>
    <TabPanels>
      <TabPanel>
<span>

```objectivec
[[[RudderClient sharedInstance] getContext] putDeviceToken:[self getDeviceToken]];
```
</span>
      </TabPanel>
      <TabPanel>
<span>

```kotlin
RudderClient.putDeviceToken(getDeviceToken())
```
</span>
      </TabPanel>
    </TabPanels>
</Tabs>

Alternatively, you can also enter the preferred event name during the Customer.io destination configuration in the RudderStack dashboard, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/customerio-device-token.png" alt="Customer.io device token settings" />

<div class="warningBlock">
Make sure you send the event just after setting the device token in your app, so RudderStack can immediately register the device token on that event and not delay until the next lifecycle event.
</div>

The following snippets highlight sending the `device_token_registered` event after setting the device token in your app:

<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>iOS</Tab>
    <Tab>Android</Tab>
  </TabList>
    <TabPanels>
      <TabPanel>
<span>

```objectivec
[[RSClient sharedInstance] track:@"device_token_registered"];
```
</span>
      </TabPanel>
      <TabPanel>
<span>

```kotlin
rudderClient!!.track("device_token_registered")
```
</span>
      </TabPanel>
    </TabPanels>
</Tabs>

RudderStack also supports the removal of the device (identified by `device_id`) whenever a custom event `Application Uninstalled` is sent to Customer.io.
