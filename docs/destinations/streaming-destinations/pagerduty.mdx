[PagerDuty](https://www.PagerDuty.com/) is a tool for instant mobile alerting. It generates real-time alerts to inform teams about incidents and automatically delivers critical information to the right people at the right time.

<div class="successBlock">
RudderStack also supports PagerDuty as a source. Refer to the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/cloud-apps/PagerDuty/">PagerDuty source</Link> documentation for more information.

## Getting started

RudderStack supports sending events to PagerDuty via the following <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">connection modes</a>:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Device mode** | -  | - | - |
| **Cloud mode** | **Supported**  | **Supported** | **Supported** |

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to PagerDuty, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **PagerDuty**.
2. Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.

## Connection settings

To successfully configure PagerDuty as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

- **PagerDuty Routing Key**: Enter the Routing Key from PagerDuty Service. Refer to the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section for more information on obtaining the team secret.
- **dedup_key Field Identifier**: Enter a category for the alert, for example, `IT`. Refer to the <Link to="#signl-categories">Signl categories</Link> section to learn more about these categories.

## Track

You can use the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track">`track`</Link> call to push alerts for events with a particular alert title, message, or other additional details.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Security Alert", {
  "status": "UP",
  "message": "Aggressive passenger",
  "Source": "Gate agent",
  "Type": "Security"
});
```

You can pass any key-value pair in the `track` call; RudderStack maps it as is in the PagerDuty destination.
