## Getting started

RudderStack supports sending events to Signl4 via the following <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">connection modes</a>:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Device mode** | -  | - | - |
| **Cloud mode** | **Supported**  | **Supported** | **Supported** |

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Signl4, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Signl4**.
2. Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.

## Connection settings

To successfully configure Signl4 as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/shynet-connection-settings.png" alt="Signl4 connection settings"/>

- **API Key**: Enter the team secret of your SIGNL4 team.

For the below mentioned connection settings, RudderStack dashboard provides:
- **Default Value**: You can provide the actual value for the field
- **RudderStack property name**: You can provide a property name whose actual value will be taken from the payload and assigned to the field.

Although these settings are optional, if specified, the higher priority is given to the **RudderStack property name**.

- **X-S4-Service**: Assigns the Signl to the service/system category with the specified name.
- **X-S4-Location**: Enter a name for the RudderStack property which will transmit the location information along with your event. YOu can pass a default location in the **Default Value** field. If your location is in the (latitude, longitude) format, a map is also displayed in the mobile app.
- **X-S4-AlertingScenario**: If the event triggers a Signl, allows to control how SIGNL4 notifies the team. Pass single_ack if Only one person needs to acknowledge this Alert. Pass multi_ack  if Alert must be confirmed by the number of people who are on duty at the time this Alert is created. Pass emergency if All people in the team are notified regardless of their duty status and must acknowledge the Alert, which is also assigned to the built-in emergency category.
- **X-S4-ExternalID**: If the event originates from a record in a 3rd party system, use this parameter to pass the unique ID of that record. That ID will be communicated in outbound webhook notifications from SIGNL4, which is great for correlation/synchronization of that record with the Alert.
- **X-S4-Status**: If you want to resolve an existing Signl by an external id (X-S4-ExternalID), you can add this status parameter. It has three possible values: new - to create a new alert, acknowledged - to acknowledge the alert having given X-S4-ExternalID, resolved - to resolve the alert having given X-S4-ExternalID

X-S4-Filtering

- **Enable to add filter**: 


Specify a boolean value of true or false to apply event filtering for this event, or not. If set to true, the event will only trigger a notification to the team, if it contains at least one keyword from one of your services and system categories (i.e. it is whitelisted).

- **Event to title mapping**: Enter the event name and alert title which to be mapped correspondingly.

## Track

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track">`track`</Link> call can be used to push alerts for the events having a particular alert title, alert message, or other additional details.

The category of alert raised in the Signl4 dashboard is decided on the basis of keywords in the payload. Reference: [here](https://account.signl4.com/manage/Category). For example, an event payload containing any of the keywords like `ambulance` ,`doctor` ,`hospital` ,`nurse`, `surgery` etc., are categorized as **Healthcare**.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(event, {
  "status": "UP",
  "message": "Agressive passenger",
  "Source": "Gate agent",
  "Type": "Security"
});
```

You can pass any key-value pair in the `track` call which is mapped as it is in the Signl4 destination.
