## Getting started

Before configuring Quantum Metric as a destination in RudderStack, make sure that the source platform is supported by Quantum Metric by referring to the following table:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Device mode** | **Supported** | - | - |
| **Cloud mode** | - | - | - |

Once you have confirmed that Quantum Metric supports the source type, follow these steps:

* From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderlabs.com/), add the source. Then, select **Quantum Metric** from the list of destinations.
* Assign a name to your destination, and then click on **Next**. You should then see the following screen:

Your can get the Site ID by logging into your [**IAM Quantum Metric dashboard**](https://iam.quantummetric.com/). There, select the **Account** button in the top-right corner. Then, click on **Install** and inspect the installation tag. Your site ID will be found in the following line:

```javascript
qtm.src = 'https://cdn.quantummetric.com/qscripts/quantum-<SITE_ID>.js';
```
</div>

* Finally, click on **Next** to complete the configuration. Quantum Metric will now be added and enabled as a device-mode destination in RudderStack.

<div class="infoBlock">
As this is a web device mode-only integration, the <strong>Use native SDK to send events</strong> option cannot be disabled. For more information on the web device mode, refer to the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</Link> guide.

## Sending events to Quantum Metric
