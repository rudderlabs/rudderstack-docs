| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

- **Board ID**: Enter your monday.com board ID.
- **Group Title**: Enter the group title of your board if you want to add an item to a specific group.

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on getting these details, refer to the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section below.
</div>

- **Columns to property mapping**: Enter the column names from your monday.com board and the corresponding RudderStack event properties to be mapped.

<div class="warningBlock">
<ul>
<li>The column names provided in the mapping should be existing in your monday.com board.</li> 
<li>RudderStack will only update the column names provided in this mapping.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="warningBlock">
RudderStack will discard the events <strong>not included</strong> in the allowlist.
</div>

## Track

You can use the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track">`track`</Link> call to create an item in your board. To do so, you need to specify the **Board ID** and **Columns to property mapping** in the dashboard settings.

You can also override the board ID mentioned in the RudderStack dashboard by passing it in the `externalId` in the track call. A sample `track` call for the same is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("create an item", {
  "status": "Done",
  "latitude": "50.32",
  "longitude": "46.32",
  "address": "New York, USA",
  "mobile_number": "+1-202-555-0146",
  "countryShortName": "US"
}, {
  "externalId": [{
    "type": "boardId",
    "id": "3536273222"
  }],
});
```

<div class="warningBlock">
The event passed in the <code class="inline-code">track</code> call should be added in the <strong>Allowlist</strong> connection setting, otherwise it will be discarded.
</div>
