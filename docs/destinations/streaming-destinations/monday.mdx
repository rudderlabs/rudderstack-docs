## Track

In Monday, you can use the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track">`track`</Link> call to create an item in your board. You also need to provide the **Board ID** and **column to property mapping** in the RudderStack dashboard to create an item. 

You can also provide a group title (optional) to add a new item to any specific group.

<div class="infoBlock">
The column names provided in the mapping should be existing in your board. Only the column names provided in the mapping will be updated.
</div>

The following column types can be updated while creating a new item on the board:

- Status 
- Numbers 
- Text 
- Checkbox
- Country 
- Email 
- Item name 
- Link 
- Location 
- Long Text 
- Phone 
- Rating 
- World Clock

<div class="infoBlock">
<ul>
<li>If you map a checkbox column, the checkbox value will be set to true by default.</li>
<li>The <code class="inline-code">timezone</code> for world clock must be in continent/city format, for example, Europe/London.</li>
</ul>
</div>


You can override the board ID mentioned in the RudderStack dashboard's connection setting by passing it in the `externalId` in the track call. A sample `track` call for the same is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("create an item", {
  "status": "Done",
  "latitude": "50.32",
  "longitude": "46.32",
  "address": "New York, USA",
  "mobile_number": "7383222323",
  "countryShortName": "IN"
}, {
  "externalId": [{
    "type": "boardId",
    "id": "3536273222"
  }],
});
```

<div class="infoBlock">
Make sure the event passed in the track call is added in the allowlist connection setting in the dashboard, otherwise it will be discarded.
</div>
