<div class="infoBlock">
Find the open source code for this destination in the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/sendgrid">GitHub repository</a>.
</div>

## Getting started

RudderStack supports sending event data to SendGrid via the following <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">connection modes</a>:

| Connection Mode     | Web           | Mobile                 | Server        |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :--------------------- | :-------------|
| **Device mode**     | -             | -                      | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported**          | **Supported** |

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to SendGrid, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **SendGrid**.
2. Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.

## Connection settings

To successfully configure SendGrid as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

- **API Key**: Enter your SendGrid API Key. Refer to the [SendGrid documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys) for more information on obtaining the API Key.
- **Email Subject**: Enter the subject of the email. You can also send it via the `subject` field in the `track` call's properties. For more information, refer to the <Link to="#track">Track</Link> section below.
- **Template ID**: Enter the **Template ID** present in your <a href="https://app.sendgrid.com/">SendGrid dashboard</a> > **Email API** > **Dynamic Templates**. You can also set the Template ID via the `templateId` field in the `track` call's properties.

<div class="infoBlock">
<code class="inline-code">templateId</code> in the <code class="inline-code">track</code> call gets higher priority over the <strong>Template ID</strong> specified in the RudderStack dashboard.
</div>

- **Get email ID from traits**: Enable this setting to let RudderStack search for the user's `email` inside the user's `traits`. If found, you can send an event to SendGrid without any `track` call properties.

<div class="warningBlock">
This option is only useful when there are no properties in the <code class="inline-code">track</code> call. SendGrid requires either the <code class="inline-code">templateId</code> or <code class="inline-code">content</code> for a successful event delivery. 
</div>

- **Reply-To Email**: Enter the email address where the email reply or bounce should be returned.
- **Reply-To Name**: Enter the user's name associated with the above email address.

<div class="infoBlock">
You can also send the email ID and name in the <code class="inline-code">replyTo</code> field in the <code class="inline-code">track</code> call's properties. Note that these fields will override the <strong>Reply-To Email</strong> and <strong>Reply-To Name</strong> fields set in the RudderStack dashboard.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on how to send these details via the <code class="inline-code">replyTo</code> object, refer to the <Link to="#replyto">replyTo</Link> section below.
</div>

- **IP Pool Name**: Enter your SendGrid IP Pool name. For detailed steps on creating an IP pool, refer to the <a href="https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/ip-pools#create-an-ip-pool">SendGrid documentation</a>.

<div class="infoBlock">
The length of the IP Pool name must be between 2 and 64 characters. 
</div>

- **SendGrid Contact List Id**: Enter the SendGrid's contact list ID where you want to create a contact. Refer to the [SendGrid documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/lists/get-all-lists) to use their API endpoint to retrieve all your contact lists with their IDs.
- **Map your traits to SendGrid custom fields**: Use this setting to map the RudderStack properties with SendGrid's custom fields.


#### From

- **Email ID**: Enter the user's email address through which the email will be sent. For more information on creating a verified sender identity, refer to this <a href="https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/sender-verification">SendGrid documentation</a>.

- **Name**: Enter the name associated with above email ID.

<div class="infoBlock">
You can also include <code class="inline-code">email</code> and <code class="inline-code">name</code> inside the <code class="inline-code">from</code> object in the <code class="inline-code">track</code> call (shown below). Note that this will override the <strong>Email</strong> and <strong>Name</strong> fields specified in the RudderStack dashboard.
</div>

```javascript
from:{
    "email": "test@email.com",
    "name": "test"
}
```

#### Event names

- **Event**: Create the list of events for which RudderStack makes the `track` calls.

<div class="warningBlock">
RudderStack <strong>discards</strong> any <code class="inline-code">track</code> call made with an event name that is not specified in this list.
</div>

#### Content

- **Type**: Enter the type of value for the content of your email.
- **value**: Enter the actual value to be included in the email.

<div class="infoBlock">
You can also send the <code class="inline-code">content</code> array via the <code class="inline-code">track</code> properties (shown below) which will override the dashboard settings.
</div>

```javascript
content: [
    {
        "type": "text/plain",
        "value": "sample text"
    }
]
```

#### Attachments

Use the **Attachments** settings to specify any attachments you want to include in your email. The individual settings are as follows:

- **Content**: This should be a Base64-encoded string.
- **Type**: The attachment **type** contains the type of content you are attaching, for example, `"text/plain"`, `"text/html"`, etc.
- **Filename**: Use this setting to specify the attachment's file name.
- **Disposition**: This option specifies how you would like the attachment to be displayed.
- **Content ID**: Use this option when **disposition** is set to `inline` and the attachment is an image.

<div class="infoBlock">
SendGrid requires that each attachment element must contain <strong>content</strong> and <strong>filename</strong>. The attachments can also be sent via the <code class="inline-code">track</code> call (shown below), which will override the dashboard settings.
</div>

```javascript
attachments:[
    {
        "content": "base64encodedString",
        "filename": "index.html",
        "type": "text/html",
        "disposition": "attachment"
    }
]
```

#### ASM

The **ASM** settings allow you to handle the user's unsubscribing activity. The configurable options are:

- **Group ID**: This option specifies the unsubscribe group to associate with this email.
- **Groups**: This option contains the array of unsubscribing groups that would be displayed in the unsusbcribing preferences page.

<div class="infoBlock">
SendGrid requires that the <strong>Group ID</strong> should always be present if the <code class="inline-code">asm</code> object is to be sent.
</div>

#### Email settings

* To include a default footer in every mail, enable the **Footer** option. When enabled, the **text** option contains the plain content of footer. The **HTML** contains the HTML content of footer.

<div class="infoBlock">

The footer can also be sent via <code class="inline-code">track</code> properties (shown below), which will override the dashboard settings.
</div>

```javascript
mailSettings:{
    "footer": true,
    "footerText": "plain text",
    "footerHtml": "html content"
}
```

* To send a test mail and ensure everything is correct, you can enable the **Sandbox Mode** setting.

<div class="infoBlock">

The sandbox mode can also be enabled or disabled via the <code class="inline-code">track</code> properties (shown below), which will override the dashboard setting.
</div>

```javascript
mailSettings:{
    "sandboxMode": true
}
```

#### Tracking settings

The following table describes the various tracking settings to be configured in the RudderStack dashboard:

| **Setting** | **Description** |
|:--------|:------------|
|**Click Tracking** | Allows you to track if a recipient clicked a link in your email.|
|**Click Tracking enable text** | Indicates if this setting should be included in the text/plain portion of your email. |
|**Open Tracking** |Allows you to track if the email was opened by including a single pixel image in the body of the content. |
|**Substitution Tag** | When **Open Tracking** is enabled, this setting allows you to specify a substitution tag that you can insert in the email body at a specific location.|
|**Subscription Tracking** |Allows you to insert a subscription management link at the bottom of your email's text and HTML bodies. |
|**Text**|When **Subscription Tracking** is enabled, this setting refers to the string to be appended to the email with the subscription tracking link. |
|**HTML**|When **Subscription Tracking** is enabled, this is appended to the email with the subscription tracking link.|
|**Substitution Tag** | Refers to the tag that will be replaced with the unsubscribe URL.|
|**GAnalytics** |Allows you to enable Google Analytics tracking. |
|**utm source** |Refers to the name of the referrer source, e.g. Google. |
|**utm medium** | Refers to the name of the marketing medium, e.g. Email.|
|**utm term**| This setting is used to identify any paid keywords.|
|**utm content**  | Allows you to differentiate your campaign from advertisements.|
|**utm campaign** | Corresponds to the name of the campaign.|

<div class="infoBlock">

The <strong>utm source</strong>, <strong>utm medium</strong>, <strong>utm term</strong>, <strong>utm content</strong>, <strong>utm campaign</strong> options are associated with the <strong>GAnalytics</strong> setting on the dashboard.
</div>

Finally, click **Next** to complete the setup. SendGrid will now be enabled as a destination in RudderStack.

## Identify

You can use the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify">`identify`</Link> call to create a new contact in SendGrid based on their email ID. If the email ID already exists, RudderStack updates the contact details. 

RudderStack sends the `identify` events to SendGrid in a batch where the batch limit is 30000.

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("1hKOmRA4el9Z", {
  name: "Alex Keener",
  email: "alex@example.com"
}, {
  "externalId": [{
    "type": "listIds",
    "id": ["037ae8d4-25b4-496e-adff-2fded15fd0c5", "137ae8d4-25b4-496e-adff-2fded15fd0c3"]
  }],
});
```

You can pass the SendGrid `listId` in any of the following ways:

- In the `externalId` object as shown in the above code snippet (takes the highest precedence)
- In the **SendGrid Contact List Id** RudderStack dashboard setting.

### Supported mappings

The following table lists the property mappings betweeen RudderStack and SendGrid:

| RudderStack property | SendGrid property|
| :-------------------- | :---------------------- |
| `email` <br/> <span style="color: #4D4DFF;font-size:12px;">Required</span>   | `email` |
| `city`   | `city` |
| `country` | `country` |
| `first_name`   | `first_name` |
| `last_name` | `last_name` |
| `postal_code`   | `postal_code` |
| `state_province_region` | `state` |
| `address_line_1`   | `address` |
| `phone_number` | `phone_number` |

<div class="infoBlock">
If you send any custom field in the event payload, make sure it is present in SendGrid and mapped in the <strong>Map your traits to SendGrid custom fields</strong> RudderStack dashboard setting.
</div>

### Deleting a user

You can delete a contact in SendGrid using the <Link to="/api/data-regulation-api/#adding-a-suppression-with-delete-regulation">Suppression with Delete regulation</Link> of the RudderStack <Link to="/api/data-regulation-api/">Data Regulation API</Link>.

<div class="infoBlock">
To delete a user, you must specify their <code class="inline-code">userId</code> in the event. Additionally, you can specify a custom identifier (optional) in the event.
</div>

A sample regulation request body for deleting a user in SendGrid is shown below:

```json
{
  "regulationType": "suppress_with_delete",
  "destinationIds": [
    "2FIKkByqn37FhzczP23eZmURciA"
  ],
  "users": [{
      "userId": "eab57ccf-6322-498e-9338-7761c6dc0656"
    },
    {
      "userId": "47983ca9-7cc6-4942-8ff0-ac443g95658d"
    }
  ],
}
```

## Track

The `track` call lets you send an event to SendGrid along with its properties. **Note that the properties specified in the `track` call will override the settings specified in the RudderStack dashboard.**

<div class="warningBlock">

Note that SendGrid requires either the <code class="inline-code">templateId</code> or <code class="inline-code">content</code> to be present in the body. Otherwise, the event will be <strong>discarded</strong>.
</div>

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track('testing',
      {
          "personalizations": [
          {
            "to": [
              {
                "email": "recipient@email.com",
                "name": "Name"
              }
            ],
            "cc": [
                {
                    "email": "ccUser@gmail.com",
                    "name": "CCUser"
                },
                {
                    "email": "ccUser2@gmail.com",
                    "name": "CCUser2"
                }
            ],
            "subject": "subject"
          }
        ],
        "from": {
            "email": "test@email.com",
            "name": "Name here"
        },
        "attachments":[
            {
                "content": "base64encodedString",
                "filename": "index.html",
                "type": "text/html",
                "disposition": "attachment"
            }
        ],
        "content":[
            {
                "type": "text/html",
                "value": "<p>Hello</p>"
            }
        ],
        "templateId": "value",
        "headers":{
            "key": "value"
        },
        "customArgs":{
            "key": "value"
        },
        "categories": ["sample","values","here"],
        "sendAt": 1617260400,
        "batchId": "some valid batch ID",
        "subject": "Subject Value",
        "mailSettings":{
          "bypassBounceManagement": true,
          "bypassSpamManagement": true,
          "bypassUnsubscribeManagement": true,
          "footer": true,
          "footerText": "text",
          "footerHtml": "html",
          "sandboxMode": true
        },
        "replyTo":{
          "email": "testingreplyto@email.com",
          "name": "Name"
        },
        "replyToList":[
            {
                "email": "test@gmail.com",
                "name": "Test"
            }
        ],
        "field1": "value"
  });
```
The following sections highlight some important things to keep in mind while using the `track` call to send customer data to SendGrid.

### `categories`

SendGrid allows the `categories` array to have a maximum of 10 values.

### `customArgs`

If `customArgs` is not provided in the `track` call, the non-default fields are taken as custom fields. In the sample `track` call above, `field1` will be mapped inside `customArgs`.

### Email settings

To send the event to SendGrid successfully, the following points must be kept in mind:

* In the `mailSettings`, you cannot combine `bypassListManagement` with `bypassBounceManagement`, `bypassSpamManagement`, and `bypassUnsubscribeManagement`. 

* If `bypassListManagement` is present, then neither `bypassSpamManagement`, `bypassBounceManagement`, or `bypassUnsubscribeManagement` can be present.

### `personalizations` 

SendGrid requires that the `personalizations` array should be present in every event and each object must contain the field `to`. 

* If the **Get email ID from traits** option is enabled in the RudderStack dashboard and the properties are not sent in track call, RudderStack will look for `email` in the event traits. If found, RudderStack will create a `personalizations` object and assign `email` to the `to` field. 

* In case both **Template ID** and **content** are not assigned in the dashboard settings, the event will **not** be sent as either of `templateId` or `content` is required.

### `replyTo`

Note that SendGrid does not allow only `name` to be sent in the `replyTo`  object. `email` must be present too, otherwise the `replyTo` object will be ignored.

A sample `replyTo` object is as shown:

```javascript
replyTo:{
    "email": "test@email.com",
    "name": "test"
}
```

### `asm`

It is mandatory to have the `groupId` field inside the `asm` object.

### Event name

As mentioned in the [**Connection settings**](#connection-settings) section above, the event names for which a `track` call is made must be specified in the RudderStack dashboard. In the sample `track` call above, `testing` is the event name that should be configured in the RudderStack dashboard. Otherwise, this event will be discarded.

### `content`

Each object inside `content` array must contain the `type` and `value` fields. If these fields are absent, then the object will be dropped. However, note that the event will **not** be discarded.

### `attachments`

Each object inside attachments array must at least contain the `content` and `filename` fields. If these fields are absent, then the object will be dropped. However the event will **not** be discarded.
