[Axeptio](https://www.axeptio.eu/) is a cookie and consent management platform. It enables you to use interesting widgets and compelling UI to enhance users' cookie/consent experience while keeping your web performance intact.

## Getting started

RudderStack supports sending event data to Axeptio via the following <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">connection modes</a>:

| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Device mode | Supported | - | - |
| Cloud mode | -  | - | - |

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Axeptio, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Axeptio**.
2. Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.

## Connection settings

To successfully configure Axeptio as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

- **Client ID**: Enter your Axeptio client ID. For more information on obtaining the client ID, refer to the <Link to="#faq">FAQ</Link> section below.
- **Toggle it on to send data through callback**: Enable this setting to allow RudderStack to track and record the callback events from the Axeptio SDK as `track` events.
- **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Axeptio. For more information on this setting, refer to the <Link to="/sources/sdks/event-filtering/">Client-side Events Filtering</Link> guide.
- **Use device mode to send events**: Enable this setting to send your events to Axeptio via the <Link to="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">web device mode</Link>.

You can keep it disabled if you only want to load the Axeptio SDK natively and not send any events.

- **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate <Link to="/sources/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/consent-managers/onetrust/">OneTrust</Link> cookie consent groups to Axeptio.

## Tracking callback events

The Axeptio SDK triggers events whenever a user interacts with the cookie/consent widgets integrated with your website.

By enabling the **Toggle it on to send data through callback** setting in the RudderStack dashboard, RudderStack tracks and records the interaction events as <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track/">`track`</Link> events. You can then view and analyze these events in the other tools (connected to the same source in RudderStack).

RudderStack maps the name and the payload of the triggered interaction event to the `track` event name and properties respectively.

## FAQ

### Where can I find the Axeptio client ID?
