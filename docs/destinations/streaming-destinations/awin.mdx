2. Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.

## Connection settings

To successfully configure Awin as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

## Track

You can use the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track">`track`</Link> call to [send the conversion data directly to Awin's servers](https://wiki.awin.com/index.php/Advertiser_Tracking_Guide/Conversion_Pixel_Only_Tracking#Server_To_Server_.28S2S.29).

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Product Purchased New", {
  revenue: 4.99,
  currency: "USD",
  commissionGroup: "CD",
  name: "Shirt",
  voucherCode: "FIRSTSALE",
  order_id: "ORD123",
});
```
