To enable sending data to Drip, you will first need to add it as a destination in RudderStack. Once the destination is configured and enabled, events from RudderStack will start flowing to Drip.

Before configuring Drip as a destination, verify if Drip supports the source platform by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | **Supported** | -             | -             |
| **Cloud** **mode**  | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</Link> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source supports sending events to Drip, follow these steps:

- From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **Drip**.
- Give a name to the destination and click on **Next**. You should then see the following screen:

- Next, enter your Drip **Account ID**. To get your **Account ID**, [**sign in**](https://login.getdrip.com/login/email) to your Drip dashboard and go to **Settings** - **Account**. Scroll down to see your Account ID.

- Enter your Drip **API Token**. To get your Drip API token, go to **Settings** - **User Settings** in your Drip dashboard.

<div class="infoBlock">
The API token is required when using the Cloud mode to send your data.
</div>

- Enter your **Campaign ID**. To get your campaign ID, go to **Campaigns** - **Email Series** and choose the relevant campaign. The last part of the URL is the campaign ID, e.g. `https://www.getdrip.com/account_id/campaigns/campaign_id`.

<div class="infoBlock">
If the Campaign ID is provided, RudderStack will try to subscribe the users by default.
</div>

<div class="successBlock">
You can also send your Campaign ID via the <code class="inline-code">identify</code> call, which takes a higher precedence.
</div>

- **User Creation Mode** This option lets you create the user with their `email` using the `track` call, if the user doesn't already exist.
- **Use device-mode to send events**: Enable this option to send events via the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">web device mode</Link>.
- Finally, click on **Next**. That's it! Drip will now be enabled as a destination in Rudderstack.
