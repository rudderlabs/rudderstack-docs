## Getting started

To enable sending data to Autopilot, you will first need to add it as a destination to the source from which you are sending your event data. Once the destination is enabled, events from our SDK will start flowing to Autopilot.

| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | -       | -             | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | -       | **Supported** | **Supported** |
