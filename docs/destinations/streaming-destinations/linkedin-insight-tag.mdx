The [LinkedIn Insight Tag](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/insight-tag) is a JavaScript code for your website that lets you track your conversions and retarget your website visitors and customers who interact with your ads. You can use the resulting insights to learn more about your customers and optimize your marketing campaigns.

RudderStack supports integration with the LinkedIn Insight Tag where you can seamlessly send your event data to LinkedIn.

## FAQ

### How does this integration work?

The RudderStack-LinkedIn Insight Tag integration workflow is explained below:

1. Configure **LinkedIn Insight Tag** as a destination in the [RudderStack dashboard](https://www.app.rudderstack.com/).
2. Install the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/quick-start-guide/#step-1-install-javascript-sdk">RudderStack JavaScript SDK</Link> on your website.
3. The JavaScript SDK automatically loads the Insight Tag tracking code.
4. The Insight Tag starts tracking the user activities on your website.

### What information can I track using the LinkedIn Insight Tag?

The LinkedIn Insight Tag lets you collect the data related to your users' website visit, including the URL, IP address, referrer, device and browser characteristics, and timestamp.

### Will this integration slow my website down?

The RudderStack SDK loads asynchronously with your website. When loading the LinkedIn Insight Tag tracking snippet, it will not slow down your website's performance at all.

### Where can I find my LinkedIn partner ID?

To get the Partner ID, open the Insight Tag and get the value corresponding to the  `_linkedin_partner_id` parameter, as shown:

Alternatively, you can follow the below steps:

1. Sign into your [LinkedIn Campaign Manager](https://www.linkedin.com/campaignmanager/login).
2. Create an ad account. Enter your account name, an optional LinkedIn page, and currency information. As of now, no payment is required.

5. If you have already set up your Insight Tag before, you will see the **Manage Insight Tag** option. Click it and choose **See Tag**.
6. Next, click **I will use a tag manager**. You should now be able to see your **Partner ID**.

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/insight-tag-partner-id-4.png" alt="LinkedIn Insight Tag partner ID" />

Copy and paste this **Partner ID** in the RudderStack dashboard to set up your LinkedIn Insight Tag destination. You will also be able to see the website domains on which the Insight Tag is loaded, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/insight-tag-partner-id-5.png" alt="LinkedIn Insight Tag partner ID" />

<div class="warningBlock">
Each LinkedIn Insight Tag has a uniqueÂ Partner ID. If the Partner ID of the tag on your website does not match the Partner ID in your account, your conversions will be unable to collect the page loads and event-specific conversions.
