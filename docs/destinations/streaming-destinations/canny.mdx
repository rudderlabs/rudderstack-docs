[Canny](https://Canny.org/), 

RudderStack supports Canny as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your event data.

## Getting started

Before configuring Canny as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Canny by referring to the table below:

| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Device mode | - | - | - |
| Cloud mode |Supported  | Supported | Supported |

<div class="infoBlock">
To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</Link> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Canny, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Canny**.
2. Assign a name to the destination and click on **Continue**.

## Connection settings

To successfully configure Canny as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

- **API Key**: Enter your server URL mentioned under the **JavaScript Tracking Code** section in Canny dashboard.

<div class="infoBlock">
Refer to the <Link to="#faq">FAQ</Link> section below for more information on finding the API Key.
</div>

### Event settings

- **Mapping to trigger Canny Events for the respective Event**: Enter the event name and pick the standard event from the dropdown to be triggered when that event is called.

<div class="successBlock">
You can specify multiple <strong>Standard Events</strong> for one <strong>Event Name</strong> and vice versa.
</div>

## Identify

RudderStack sets the ID value in the cache to the `userId` or `anonymousId` present in the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify/">`identify`</Link> call. 

Finds the id for a user. If the user does not exist, one is created, and its id is returned. If the user does exist, they will be updated with the data supplied.
Why is this endpoint useful? If you're going to use an object creation API endpoint (such as create a post), you may have to create the author's account before creating the post.

API Used : `https://canny.io/api/v1/users/create_or_update`

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("user001", {
    "name": "John Denver",
    "email": "john@testmail.com",
    "gender": "Male",
    "profession": "singer-songwriter",
    "companies": [{
        "created": "2020-01-23T04:56:07.890Z",
        "customFields": {
            "field1": "value1",
        },
        "id": "company123",
        "monthlySpend": 500.00,
        "name": "company name"
    }]
});
```

#### Property mappings

## Track

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track/">`track`</Link> method lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.

By using track we can create posts or vote on behalf of a user. Segment doesnâ€™t support these functionalities.

We can retrieve user data using userId or email and use that information to make posts or vote.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Order Completed",{
"category": "Orders",
"action": "Pass",
"value": 15
});
```
