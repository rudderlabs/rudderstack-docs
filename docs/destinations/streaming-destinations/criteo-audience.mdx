## `audienceList` event structure

RudderStack supports <a href="https://developers.criteo.com/marketing-solutions/docs/contact-list#adding-and-removing-users-in-an-audience">adding and removing users in an audience list</a>.

The following code snippet shows a sample `audienceList` call:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "type": "ContactlistAmendment",
    "attributes": {
      "operation": "add" / "remove",
      "identifierType": "email",
      "identifiers": [
        "example1@gmail.com"
      ],
      "gumCallerId": "",
      "internalIdentifier": "false"
    }
  }
}
```

In the above snippet, you can pass the `identifierType` as:
- `email`: Email Address
- `madid`: Mobile Ad Identifier
- `identityLink`: LiveRamp Identity Link
- `gum`: Criteo GUM cookie identifier

Refer to the [Criteo documentation](https://developers.criteo.com/marketing-solutions/docs/contact-list#adding-and-removing-users-in-an-audience) for more information on these identifier types.

Criteo's API implements [rate limits](https://developers.criteo.com/marketing-solutions/docs/rate-limits) to limit the number of requests you're able to perform on any API endpoint per minute.
