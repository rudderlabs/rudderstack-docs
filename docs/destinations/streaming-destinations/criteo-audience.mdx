## Getting started

RudderStack supports sending event data to Criteo Audience via the following <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">connection modes</a>:

| Connection Mode | Web       | Mobile | Server |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :--------- | :--------- |
| **Device mode**     | - | -          | -          |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported**  -  | **Supported**-  | - -  |


Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Criteo Audience, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Criteo Audience**.
2. Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.

## Connection settings

To successfully configure Criteo Audience as a destination, you need to configure the following settings:

- **Create Account**: Click **Create Account** > **Connect with Criteo Audience** and enter your login credentials for Criteo Audeince.
- **Audience Id**: Enter the audience ID of the audience to which you want to sync the data.
- **Audience Type**: Criteo Audience lets you use the email addresses in both hashed and non-hashed formats. If you choose **MD5**, RudderStack will hash-encode the email address before sending it to Criteo Audience.
- **Map Specific Fields to Criteo Audience Fields:** Enter the payload fields and the corresponding mapped fields that will be used to send the event data to Criteo Audience.

<div class="infoBlock">
Criteo Audience allows you to send any extra data about a page or a user to add more context to the events. You can set this feature in Criteo Audience with the assistance of your Criteo Audience Account Manager. You can then use the <strong>Map Specific Fields to Criteo Audience Fields</strong> field mapping feature to send extra data through RudderStack.
</div>

- **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Criteo Audience.

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on this setting, refer to the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/">Client-side Events Filtering</Link> guide.
</div>

- **Mapping RudderStack events to the Criteo Audience standard events**: Enter the **Event Name** and the corresponding [**Standard Event**](https://www.Criteo Audience.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/CSPOneTag_v1.1.pdf) from the dropdown. This standard event will be triggered when the mapped RudderStack event is called.

<div class="successBlock">
You can specify multiple <strong>Standard Events</strong> for one <strong>Event Name</strong> and vice versa.
</div>

- **Use device mode to send events**: As this is a <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">device mode</Link>-only destination, this setting is enabled by default and cannot be disabled .
- **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you map <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/onetrust-consent-manager/">OneTrust cookie</Link> /consent groups to RudderStack's consent purposes.

## Page

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/page/">`page`</Link> call lets you track the user's home page along with its associated properties.

<div class="infoBlock">
Use this call only to track the home page and add the users to your target audience.
</div>

The home page tag will be fired in the following three scenarios:

- When the name of the `page` call is `home`.
- When the current URL of the web page is same as the **Home Page URL** specified in the RudderStack dashboard.
- When the URL mentioned in the `properties` of the `page` call is same as the **Home Page URL** specified in the RudderStack dashboard.

<div class="warningBlock">
The home page tag will <strong>not</strong> be fired in any other scenario.
</div>

A sample `page` call is as shown below:

```javascript
window.rudderanalytics.page("category", "home", {
  path: "path",
  url: "url",
  title: "title",
  search: "search",
  referrer: "referrer",
  testDimension: "true",
})
```

## Track

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track/">`track`</Link> call lets you capture different user events and the properties associated with them.

A sample `track` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Product Viewed", {
  product_id: "Prod12345",
  quantity: 1,
  price: 19.99,
  name: "my product",
  category: "categ 1",
  sku: "p-666",
  list: "Gallery",
  testDimension: true,
  testMetric: true,
})
```

In the above example, RudderStack captures the information related to the `Product Viewed` event and the associated details such as quantity, price, category, etc.

The following table details the mapping of the <Link to="/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/">RudderStack ecommerce events</Link> and the [Criteo Audience OneTag events](https://help.Criteo Audience.com/kb/guide/en/all-Criteo Audience-onetag-events-and-parameters-vZbzbEeY86/Steps/775825).

| **RudderStack ecommerce event** | **Criteo Audience OneTag event**               | **OneTag Event Name Used By Criteo Audience** |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------- |
| `Product Viewed`                 | `Product tag`                         | `viewItem`                           |
| `Cart Viewed`                    | `Basket/cart tag`                     | `viewBasket`                         |
| `Order Completed`                | `Sales Tag`                           | `trackTransaction`                   |
| `Product List Viewed`            | `Category/keyword search/listing tag` | `viewList`                           |

<div class="infoBlock">
If the <code class="inline-code">Category/keyword search/listing tag</code> needs to be fired with the filters, enter it within the <code class="inline-code">filters</code> field of the event properties inside the <code class="inline-code">Product List Viewed</code> tag.
</div>

The `filters` field is an array of objects that consists of each filter category in every single object. Criteo Audience expects `name`, `operator,` and `value` fields for every filter that needs to be passed to Criteo Audience.

For example, a simple `Product List Viewed` event that fires a `Category/keyword search/listing Tag` is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Product List Viewed", {
  email: "name@domain.com",
  zipCode: "12345",
  category: "abc",
  keywords: "key",
  page_number: 1,
  filters: [
    {
      name: "processor",
      operator: "eq",
      value: "snapdragon",
    },
  ],
  products: [
    {
      product_id: "223344ffdds3ff3",
    },
    {
      product_id: "343344ff5567ff3",
    },
  ],
})
```
