The [Variance](https://www.variance.com) customer growth platform makes your product, marketing, and sales data operational. It lets you to create, access, and manage intent-based signals across all stages of your customers' journey.

RudderStack lets you add Variance as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your event data.

## Getting started

To enable sending data to Variance, you will first need to add it as a destination in the RudderStack dashboard. Once the destination is configured and enabled, events from RudderStack will start flowing to Variance.

Before configuring Variance in RudderStack, verify if the source platform supports sending events to RudderStack by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device Mode**     | **-**         | **-**         | **-**         |
| **Cloud Mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">
to learn more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</Link> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform is supported by Variance, perform the steps below:

- Configure the data source in RudderStack.
- From the list of destinations, select **Variance**.
- Then, assign a name to the destination and click on **Next**.
- Select the data source and click on **Next**. You will then see the following **Connection Settings** page:

- Enter the Variance **Webhook URL** and **Authorization Header Value** to configure the destination.
- To transform your event data before sending it to this destination, click on **Create New Transformation**. Otherwise, click on **Next**.

That's it! Your Variance destination is now configured and enabled.

## Identify

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify">`identify`</Link> call lets you associate a visiting user to their actions as well as record their traits.

<div class="infoBlock">
As a best practice, make sure that the <code class="inline-code">identify</code> call is made at the start of every session or page load for logged-in users, if possible. This will ensure all their latest traits are captured.
</div>

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("userid", {
  name: "Name Surname",
  email: "name@website.com",
  company: {
    id: "1",
    name: "Website",
  },
})
```

## Track

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track">`track`</Link> call allows you to record the customer events, i.e. the actions that they perform, along with their associated properties.

A sample `track` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Event Name", {
  plan: "plan value",
})
```

## Page

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/page">`page`</Link> call lets you record your website's page views, with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.

A sample `page` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page("Cart", "Cart Viewed", {
  path: "/cart",
  referrer: "test.com",
  search: "term",
  title: "test_item",
  url: "http://test.in",
})
```

## Group

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/group">`group`</Link> call lets you associate a particular identified user with a group, such as a company, organization, or an account. It also lets you record the custom traits associated with that group, such as the name of the group, number of employees, etc.

A sample `group` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.group("sample-group-id", {
  name: "Example Company",
  employees: 1000,
  industry: "Software",
})
```

## Alias

Many destination platforms need an explicit <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/alias">`alias`</Link> call for mapping the already identified users to a new user identifier that you may want to use, to track them in the future. The `alias` call lets you implement this functionality.

A sample `alias` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.alias("new_user_id");
```

## Account mapping

Variance offers a few different ways of mapping your users to accounts/companies. Here's an overview:

### Group

If you already use the `group` call to indicate the Account, then you do not need to fill in anything. Variance will extract the Account automatically, and youâ€™re good to go.

### Identify with custom traits

Choose this option if you include some information about the Account/Company/Organization as a trait in each `identify` call. When you choose this option you'll need to let Variance know the name of the trait you use.

For instance, if you pass something like `{'company':{'id':1,'name':'Awesome Inc.'}}` , you could add `company.id` as the **Account ID** trait and `company.name` as the **Account Name** trait.

### Identify email trait domain extraction (fallback)

If you don't use either of the methods above, Variance can extract the domain from the `email` trait and use that as the Account name.

<div class="infoBlock">
If none of these methods work for your setup, <a href="mailto:support@variance.com">reach out to Variance support</a> to discuss the alternatives.
