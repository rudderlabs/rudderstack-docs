## Connection settings

To successfully configure Pipedream as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

- **Pipedream URL**: Enter the URL associated with your Pipedream workflow. This is the endpoint where RudderStack sends the events. 

<div class="infoBlock">
RudderStack supports both <code class="inline-code">HTTP</code> and <code class="inline-code">HTTPS</code> URLs. For <code class="inline-code">HTTPS</code>, make sure that you have a valid TLS certificate for successful event delivery.
</div>

- **URL Method**: Choose the request method from the dropdown. RudderStack uses this method to send the HTTP requests to the configured endpoint. By default, it is set to **POST**.
- **Headers**: Use this setting to add custom headers for your events while sending requests to your webhook. By default, RudderStack automatically adds the following headers for the **POST** and **PUT** requests:

| Key            | Value              |
| :------------- | :----------------- |
| `User-Agent`   | `RudderStack`       |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |
