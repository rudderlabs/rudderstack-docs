[Loops](https://loops.so) is an email platform for SaaS companies for sending marketing and transactional emails from the same platform.

RudderStack supports Loops as a destination where you can send your event data seamlessly.

## Getting started

RudderStack supports sending event data to Loops via the following <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">connection modes</a>:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | -             | -             | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

To start sending events to Loops, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Loops**.
2. Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.

### Connection settings

To successfully configure Loops as a destination, you will need to add your Loops API key:

1. Go to your [Loops API Settings page](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=api).
2. Generate or use an existing API key.
3. Copy the key and paste it in the **API Key** field in Rudderstack.

## Events

The Loops destination supports identify and track events.

### Identify

You can sync users from RudderStack to Loops as contacts using identify calls.

Add a unique user identifier as the first parameter. Contact properties included in the identify call will be added to the contact record in Loops.

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify('72893628', {
  email: 'janedoe@example.com',
  name: 'Jane Doe',
  country: 'United States',
})
```

To manage a contact's mailing list subscriptions, add a `mailingLists` property to match the expected [API format](https://loops.so/docs/api-reference/update-contact#param-mailing-lists):

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify('72893628', {
  email: 'janedoe@example.com',
  name: 'Jane Doe',
  country: 'United States',
  mailinglists: {
    clxf1nxlb000t0ml79ajwcsj0: true,
    clxf2q43u00010mlh12q9ggx1: false,
  }
})
```

New contacts must have an `email` property, otherwise they will not be created in Loops.

Existing contacts will be updated in Loops based on the provided `userId` property. If an existing contact in Loops doesn't have a `userId` property, Loops will attempt to match based on the provided `email` property. 

### Track

Track calls let you send events to Loops, which can be used to trigger <a href="https://loops.so/docs/loop-builder">loops</a>.

<div class="infoBlock">
If you omit both the `email` and `userId` value from your `track` calls, you must call `identify` first to identify the current user.
</div>

You can include [event properties](https://loops.so/docs/events/properties) in the track call, so they are available for use inside your loop emails.

The event name in your `track` call should match the name of the event in Loops, and the event properties should also match the properties in Loops. Set these up at [Settings > Events](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=events).

A sample `track` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track('signup', {
  firstName: "Bob",
  plan: "pro"
})
```

Any values in `context.traits` (for example, from a previous `identify` call) will be included in the call and updated on the contact record in Loops.

Events will appear on the [Settings > Events](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=events) page in Loops.
