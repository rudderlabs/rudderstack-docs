RudderStack lets you send your event data to Vero via the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode">cloud mode</Link>.

<div class="infoBlock">
Find the open source transformer code for this destination in the <a href="">GitHub repository</a>.
</div>

## Identify

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify/">`identify`</Link> call lets you identify a user and associate them to their actions. It also lets you record any traits about them like their name, email, etc.

RudderStack sends the `identify` events to Vero via their [`users`](https://developers.getvero.com/?bash#users) endpoint to create, update, and manage your user records and their subscription status.

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("1hKOmRA4GRlm", {
  "email": "alex@example.com",
  "gender": "Male",
  "randomKey": "randomData"
})
```

### Supported mappings

The following table lists the mapping of the RudderStack traits to the corresponding Vero properties:

| RudderStack trait | Vero property | Presence |
| :-----| :------| :-------|
| `userId` | `id` | Required, if `email` is not present. |
| `email` | `email` | Required, if `userId` is not present. |
| `traits` | `data` |  Optional |
| `context.os.name` | `channels.platform` | Optional |
| `context.device.token` | `channels.address` | Optional |
| `context.device.name` | `channels.device` | Optional |
| `context.timezone` | `timezone` | Optional |
| `context.locale`| `locale` | Optional |
| `context.userAgent` | `userAgent` | Optional |

<div class="infoBlock">
If the event includes <code class="inline-code">email</code> and no <code class="inline-code">userId</code>, Vero will automatically use <code class="inline-code">email</code> as the <code class="inline-code">id</code>.
</div>

<div class="successBlock">
You can add or update user records as required as these are the custom properties.
</div>

## Track

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track/">`track`</Link> call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.

RudderStack sends the `track` events to Vero via their [`events/track`](https://developers.getvero.com/?bash#events-track) endpoint to track events for a specific user based on the actions they take. If a user profile does not exist, Vero will create one.

A sample `track` event is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Product Viewed", {
  SKU: "P001",
  "revenue": 77.6,
  "currency": "USD",
  "review_id": "R1619" 
})
```

<div class="infoBlock">
Vero does not differentiate between the upper or lower case letters, spaces, and underscores in the event names. For example, Vero matches the <code class="inline-code">Purchased Item</code>, <code class="inline-code">purchased item</code>, and <code class="inline-code">purchased_item</code> as the same event.
</div>

### Supported mappings

The following table lists the mapping of the RudderStack properties to the corresponding Vero properties:

| RudderStack property | Vero property | Presence |
| :-----| :------| :-------|
| `userId`/`anonymousId` | `identity.id` | Required |
| `event`  | `event_name` | Required |
| `email` | `identity.email` | Optional |
| `properties` | `data` | Optional |

### Unsubscribing and resubscribing users

RudderStack supports [unsubscribing](https://developers.getvero.com/?bash#users-unsubscribe) and [resubscribing](https://developers.getvero.com/?bash#users-resubscribe) users in Vero by passing the `userId` in the `track` call, as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("unsubscribe", {
  userId: "1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm"
})
```

## Page

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/page/">`page`</Link> call lets you record your website's page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.

RudderStack sends the `page` events to Vero via their [`events/track`](https://developers.getvero.com/?bash#events-track) endpoint.

A sample `page` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page(
  "Cart",
  "Cart Viewed", {
    path: "/best-seller/1",
    referrer: "https://www.google.com/search?q=estore+bestseller",
    search: "estore bestseller",
    title: "The best sellers offered by EStore",
    url: "https://www.estore.com/best-seller/1"
  }
);
```

## Screen

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/screen/">`screen`</Link> call lets you record whenever your user views their mobile screen, with any additional relevant information about the screen.

RudderStack sends the `screen` events to Vero via their [`events/track`](https://developers.getvero.com/?bash#events-track) endpoint.

A sample `screen` call sent via the <Link to="/sources/sdk/rudderstack-android-sdk/">Android SDK</Link> is as shown:

```kotlin
MainApplication.rudderClient.screen("Home Screen",
            RudderProperty()
                .putValue("prop_key","prop_value"));
```

## Alias

RudderStack sends the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/alias/">`alias`</Link> events to Vero via their [`users/reidentify`](https://developers.getvero.com/?bash#users-alias) endpoint to change a user's identifier (`id`).

A sample `alias` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.alias("userId", "previousId");
```

### Supported mappings

The following table lists the mapping of the RudderStack properties to the corresponding Vero properties:

| RudderStack property | Vero property | Presence |
| :-----| :------| :-------|
| `userId` | `new_id` | Required |
| `previousId` | `id` | Required |

## Adding and removing tags

RudderStack supports adding and removing `tags` to all the `identify`, `track`, `page`,  and `screen` calls by passing them via the `integrations` object. An example snippet is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify(
  "1hKOmRA4GRlm", {
    email: "alex@example.com"
  }, {
    integrations: {
      Vero: {
        tags: {
          add: ["alex", "keener", "neworleans"],
          remove: ["james", "ducker", "newyork"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
);
```

You can then view the updated tags associated with that user in the Vero dashboard, as shown:
