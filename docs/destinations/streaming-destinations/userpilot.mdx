## Getting started

RudderStack supports sending event data to Userpilot via the following <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">connection modes</a>:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | **Supported** | -             | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">
In a web device mode integration, that is, using <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk">JavaScript SDK</Link> as a source, the Userpilot native SDK is loaded from <code class="inline-code">https://js.userpilot.io/</code> domain. Based on your website's content security policy, you might need to <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain">allowlist this domain</Link> to load the Userpilot SDK successfully.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Userpilot, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Userpilot**.
2. Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.

### Connection settings

To successfully configure Userpilot as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings based on your connection mode:

#### Device Mode
- **App Token**: Enter your Userpilot App Token. This is required for device mode integration. You can find this by visiting [Configure -> Environment](https://run.userpilot.io/environment) in your Userpilot dashboard.

#### Cloud Mode
- **API Key**: Enter your Userpilot API Key. This is required for cloud mode integration. You can find this on the same [Configure -> Environment](https://run.userpilot.io/environment) page in your Userpilot dashboard.

## Identify

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify/">`identify`</Link> call is used to identify a user in Userpilot and associate them with their traits.

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("user123", {
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
  name: "John Doe",
  company: "Example Corp",
  plan: "Enterprise",
  role: "Admin",
  createdAt: "2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
});
```

## Track

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track/">`track`</Link> call is used to track user events and send them to Userpilot.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Feature Used", {
  featureName: "Dashboard Export",
  exportFormat: "CSV",
  itemsExported: 42
});
```

When you make a `track` call, RudderStack sends the event to Userpilot as a custom event with the properties included in the call.

## Page

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/page/">`page`</Link> call allows you to record page views in your web app.

A sample `page` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page("Home", {
  path: "/home",
  url: "https://example.com/home",
  title: "Home Page",
  referrer: "https://google.com"
});
```

When you make a `page` call, RudderStack sends a page view event to Userpilot.

## Group

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/group/">`group`</Link> call allows you to associate users with a specific group, such as a company or organization.

A sample `group` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.group("group123", {
  name: "Example Corp",
  industry: "Technology",
  plan: "Enterprise",
  employees: 500,
  website: "https://example.com"
});
```

When you make a `group` call, RudderStack sends the group information to Userpilot, which can be used for segmentation and creating targeted experiences.
