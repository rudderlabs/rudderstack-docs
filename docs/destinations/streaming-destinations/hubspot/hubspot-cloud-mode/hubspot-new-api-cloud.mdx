description: Step-by-step guide on sending your event data from RudderStack to HubSpot using the new HubSpot API.
---

RudderStack lets you send your event data to HubSpot via the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode">cloud mode</Link>.

<div class="infoBlock">
Find the open source transformer code for this destination in the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/v0/destinations/hs">GitHub repository</a>.
</div>

## Identify

RudderStack sends the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify">`identify`</Link> call to check if a contact exists, if it does, RudderStack updates the user with the new information. Otherwise, it creates a new user.

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify({
  firstName: "Alex",
  city: "New Orleans",
  country: "USA",
  phone: "+1-202-555-0146",
  email: "alex@example.com",
  custom_flavor: "chocolate",
  custom_date: 1574769933368,
  custom_date1: new Date("2019-10-14T11:15:53.296Z"),
})
```

## Track

A <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track/">`track`</Link> call lets you record various user actions and any properties associated with them. 

To associate a `track` call with a user, you need to specify the user's `email` under `context.traits`. 

<div class="infoBlock">
RudderStack associates the <code class="inline-code">track</code> events with the same user after an <code class="inline-code">identify</code> request is successfully made. However, if you send a <code class="inline-code">track</code> call without making any <code class="inline-code">identify</code> call first, and there is no contact in HubSpot, there will be no association of events as there is no identifier.
</div>

A sample `track` event is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(
  "Order Completed", {
    value: 30,
  }, {
    context: {
      traits: {
        firstname: "Alex",
        city: "New Orleans",
        country: "USA",
        phone: "+1-202-555-0146",
        email: "alex@example.com",
      },
    },
  }
)
```

### Property mappings

The following table lists the **optional** property mappings between RudderStack and HubSpot for the `track` call:

| RudderStack property         | HubSpot property      | 
| :--------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| `traits.utk`/`context.traits.utk`/`properties.utk`  | `utk`     | 
| `email`        | `email`       |
| `properties.occurred_at`/`originalTimestamp`  | `occurredAt`       |         
| `traits.objectId`/`context.traits.objectId`/`properties.objectId`    | `objectId`     |            

### Custom behavioral events

<div class="warningBlock">
The custom behavorial events can be used for both the authentication types. However, they must have the <code class="inline-code">analytics.behavioral_events.send</code> permission to be used for private apps.
</div>

[Custom behavioral events](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/analytics/events) are account-defined events in HubSpot that store event details in the event properties. You can create custom behavioral events and their associated properties in the RudderStack dashboard as explained in the <Link to="/destinations/streaming-destinations/hubspot-v2/#event-and-property-names">event and property names</Link> section.

The following parameters are sent in the custom behavorial events:
- **Identifier**: Either the contact ID, email, or <Link to="https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/events/tracking-code">utk</Link> (user token) of the contact associated with the event. The utk is the user token stored in the visitor's `hubspotutk` browser cookie.
- **Event name:** The internal name of the event which can be found in HubSpot.
- **Properties object**: When you create a custom behavioral event in HubSpot, some default properties are provided with those events, explained in the below section.

#### Property mappings

The following table lists the **optional** and default property mappings between RudderStack and HubSpot for custom behavioral events:

| RudderStack property         | HubSpot property      | 
| :--------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| `properties.assetDescription`/`properties.hsAssetDescription`  | `hs_asset_description`     | 
| `properties.assetType`/`properties.hsAssetType`               | `hs_asset_type`       
| `properties.campaignId`           | `hs_campaign_id`       |         
| `traits.address.city`/`context.traits.address.city`/`properties.address.city`           | `hs_city`            |          
| `traits.address.country`/`context.traits.address.country`/`properties.address.country` | `hs_country`       |            
| `context.device.name`            | `hs_device_name`            |          
| `properties.elementClass`/`properties.hsElementClass`               | `hs_element_class`               |
