## Getting started

RudderStack supports sending event data to Appcues via the following <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">connection modes</a>:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | **Supported** | -             | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">
In the web device mode integration, that is, using <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk">JavaScript SDK</Link> as a source, the Appcues native SDK is loaded from <code class="inline-code">https://fast.appcues.com/</code> domain. Based on your website's content security policy, you might need to <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain">allowlist this domain</Link> to load the Appcues SDK successfully.

You need to make an `identify` call before making any call to Appcues.
</div>

## Identify

The `identify` call is used to uniquely identify a user in Appcues. For more information on the `identify` call, please refer to the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/">RudderStack Events Specification</Link> documentation.

A sample `identify` call looks like the following snippet:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("userId", {
  name: "John Doe",
  title: "CEO",
  email: "name.surname@domain.com",
  company: "Company123",
  phone: "123-456-7890",
  state: "Texas",
  rating: "Hot",
  city: "Austin",
  postalCode: "12345",
  country: "US",
  street: "Sample Address",
  state: "TX",
})
```

The above call is directly passed on to Appcues via its `Appcues.identify(userId,[properties])` call.

## Track

A `track` call lets you track custom events as they occur in your web application. For more information on the `track` call, please refer to the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/">RudderStack Events Specification</Link> documentation.

A sample `track` call looks like the following:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Clicked button", {
  color: "red",
  buttonText: "Get started",
})
```

<div class="infoBlock">

The above call is directly passed on to Appcues via its `Appcues.track(eventName, [eventProperties])` call.

</div>

## Page

A `page` call contains information such as the URL or the name of the web page visited by the user. For more information on the `page` call, please refer to the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/">RudderStack Events Specification</Link> documentation.

A sample `page` call looks like the following:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page("homepage")
```

<div class="infoBlock">

In device mode, the `page` call is directly passed on to Appcues via its `Appcues.page()` call, along with any additional properties passed to it. Appcues will check to see if a user qualifies for an experience every time the page changes. When you first make the `page` call via RudderStackâ€™s `rudderanalytics` object, Appcues checks if there are any current flows associated with the given user and loads them, if necessary.

</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

In the cloud mode, the above `page` call is sent as a `track` event with the name as `Visited a Page`, along with any additional properties passed to it. It also updates the properties associated with the user profile such as `User ID`, `Last Browser Language`, `Updated At`, `User Agent`, `Current Page URL`, `Current Page Title` .

</div>

## Screen

<div class="infoBlock">

The `screen` call is available only in the RudderStack Cloud mode.

</div>

The `screen` method allows you to record whenever a user sees the mobile screen, along with any associated optional properties.

A sample `screen` call looks like the following code snippet:

```javascript
[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@"Main" properties:@{@"prop_key" : @"prop_value"}];
```

In the above snippet, we capture information related to the screen being viewed, such as screen's name and category.

<div class="infoBlock">

The above call is sent as a `track` event with the name `Viewed a Screen`, along with any additional properties passed to it.

</div>
