[Serenytics](https://www.serenytics.com/) is a full-featured platform for creating dashboards. Generate charts and track KPIs from multiple sources, and easily share results with management and cross-functional teams.

With this integration you can use the full range of RudderStack tools to create functions, transform and filter your events on their way to the Serenytics warehouse where you can then visualize your data.

## Getting started

RudderStack supports sending event data to Serenytics via the following <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">connection modes</a>:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | - | -             | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Serenytics, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Serenytics**.
2. Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.

## Connection settings

To configure Serenytics as a destination, first retrieve your data storage URL from the Serenytics dashboard under the **Data** tab.

## Supported Calls

All RudderStack events are sent to Serenytics and stored in the Serenytics warehouse. The most common events for each RudderStack method are mapped automatically to the Serenytics naming convention. See the method-specific table below for a reference of the standard mappings.

Properties/fields that are not included in the mapping tables are passed as `trait_{key_name}` in the Serenytics dashboard.

For example, in this example RudderStack event:

```js
rudderanalytics.identify(
    "newUser",
    {
      email: "user@gmail.com",
      phone: "+919876543210",
      subscription: "youtube",
      channelName: ["b", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k"],
      obj: {
        first: "Bob",
        last: "Smith",
      },
    }
  );
```

The `userId` and `email` properties are mapped to `user_id` and `email`, and the remaining traits are mapped as `trait_phone`, etc.:

```json
{
  user_id: "newUser",
  email: "user@gmail.com",
  trait_phone: "+919876543210",
  trait_subscription: "youtube",
  trait_channelName: ["b", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k"],
  trait_obj: {
    first: "Bob",
    last: "Smith",
  }
}
```

### Identify

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify">`identify`</Link> call lets you uniquely identify a user and record any associated traits about them like their name, email, etc.

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm", {
  likes_movies: true,
  favorite_color: "purple",
  age: 13
});
```
