[Braze](https://www.braze.com/) is a customer engagement platform that helps you better understand your customers' in-app behavior and use the insights to improve your users' app experience.

RudderStack supports Braze as a destination where you can seamlessly send your event data.

<div class="infoBlock">
Find the open source transformer code for this destination in the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/v0/destinations/braze">GitHub repository</a>.
</div>

## Getting started

Before configuring Braze as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Braze by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | **Supported** | **Supported** | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">
To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</Link> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Braze, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Braze**.
2. Assign a name to the destination and click on **Continue**.

### Connection settings

To successfully configure Braze as a destination, you need to configure the following settings:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/braze-connection-settings.png" alt="Braze connection settings" />

- **App Key**: Enter your Braze app key.
- **REST API Key**: Enter the REST API key associated with your project.

<div class="infoBlock">
When creating a new Braze Rest API Key for your app, you only need to select the <strong>users.track</strong>, <strong>users.identify</strong>, and <strong>users.alias.new</strong> endpoints under the <strong>User Data</strong> permissions.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on obtaining your Braze app key and the REST API key, refer to the <Link to="#faq">FAQ</Link> section below.
</div>

- **Data Center**: Specify the data center associated with your Braze account. The easiest way to get your data center details is to log into your Braze account and observing your URL. Some examples are shown below:

| URL                            | Data Center instance |
| :------------------- | :---------------- |
| https://dashboard-01.braze.com | US-01             |
| https://dashboard-03.braze.com | US-03             |
| https://dashboard-01.braze.eu  | EU-01             |

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on getting your data center instance, refer to the <a href="https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/administrative/access_braze/braze_instances">Braze instances</a> page.
</div>

- **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Braze.

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on this setting, refer to the <Link to="/sources/sdks/event-filtering/">Client-side Events Filtering</Link> guide.
</div>

- **Use device mode to send events**: Enable this setting to send events to Braze via the <Link to="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">device mode</Link>.
- **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate the <Link to="/sources/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/consent-managers/onetrust/">OneTrust</Link> cookie consent groups to Braze.

</ul>
      </TabPanel>
    </TabPanels>
</Tabs>

## Identify

You can use the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify/">`identify`</Link> call to identify a user in Braze in any of the following cases:

- When the user registers to the app for the first time.
- When they log into their app.
- When they update their information.

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify(
  "1hKOmRA4GRlm", {
    email: "alex@example.com",
    name: "Alex Keener"
  }
);
```

## Track

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track/">`track`</Link> call lets you record the customer events, that is, the actions that they perform, along with any properties associated with them.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Product Added", {
  numberOfRatings: "12",
  name: "item 1",
});
```

### Order Completed

When you call the `track` method for an `Order Completed` event, RudderStack sends the product information present in the event to Braze as **purchases**.

A sample `Order Completed` event is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Order Completed", {
  userId: "1hKOmRA4GRlm",
  currency: "USD",
  products: [{
      product_id: "123454387",
      name: "Game",
      price: 15.99
    }
  ],
});
```

## Page

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/page/">`page`</Link> call allows you to record your website's page views, with the additional relevant information about the viewed page.

A sample`page` call is as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page("Cart", "Cart Viewed", {
  path: "/cart",
  referrer: "test.com",
  search: "term",
  title: "test_item",
  url: "http://test.in",
})
```

## Group

You can use the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/group/">`group`</Link> call to link an identified user with a group, such as a company, organization, or an account.

```javascript
rudderanalytics.group("12345", {
  name: "MyGroup",
  industry: "IT",
  employees: 450,
  plan: "basic"
})
```

Once you send a `group` event, RudderStack sends a custom attribute to Braze with the name as `ab_rudder_group_<groupId>` and the value as `true`. For example, if the `groupId` is `123456`, then RudderStack creates a custom attribute with the name `ab_rudder_group_123456` and sends it to Braze with its value to `true`.
