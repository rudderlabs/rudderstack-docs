description: Step-by-step guide on sending your event data from RudderStack to Google Ads
---

[**Google Ads**](https://ads.google.com/) is Google's premier online advertising platform. It can be used for efficient marketing strategies such as product listing, service offerings, as well as activities such as conversion tracking.

RudderStack's Google Ads integration leverages a global site tag - `gtag.js` - a JavaScript tagging framework and an API that lets you send your event data to Google Ads.

## Getting started

RudderStack supports sending event data to  Google Ads via the following <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">connection modes</a>:

<div class="infoBlock">
You can use the JavaScript SDK to send <strong>Page Load Conversions</strong> as well as <strong>Click Conversions</strong> events to Google Ads.
</div>

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :--------- | :--------- |
| **Device mode**     | **Supported** | -          | -          |
| **Cloud mode**      | -             | -          | -          |

<div class="infoBlock">
In the web device mode integration, that is, using <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk">JavaScript SDK</Link> as a source, the Google Ads native SDK is loaded from <code class="inline-code">https://www.googletagmanager.com/</code> domain. Based on your website's content security policy, you might need to <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain">allowlist this domain</Link> to load the Google Ads SDK successfully.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source supports sending events to Google Ads, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **Google Ads**.
2. Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.

## Connection settings

To set up Google Ads as a destination, you need to configure the following settings:

- **Conversion ID**: Enter your Google Ads Conversion ID. Refer to the Google Ads <a href="https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6105160?hl=en">support page</a> for more information on obtaining the Conversion ID.
- **Mapping to trigger the Google Ads events for the respective events set here**: Use this setting to map custom event names to the standard Google Ads events.
- **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Google Ads. Refer to the <Link to="/sources/sdks/event-filtering/">Client-side Events Filtering</Link> guide for more information.
- **Configure Page Load Conversions**: For `page` call, you can configure the page load conversions for multiple instances. 
  - **Conversion Label**: Enter the conversion label from Google Ads. 
  - **Name**: Enter the name of the `page` event to be sent.
- **Click Event Conversion**: For `track` call, you can configure **Click Event Conversion**. 
  - **Conversion Label**: Enter your Google Ads conversion label. 
  - **Name**: Enter the name of the `track` event to be sent.
- **Send Page View**: Enable this setting to automatically send your `page` events to Google Ads.
- **Conversion Linker**: This setting is enabled by default. If you don't want the global site tag (`gtag.js`) to set first-party cookies on your website domain, disable this setting. Refer to the [Google Ads documentation](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7521212?hl=en) for more information on the Conversion Linker feature.

<div class="warningBlock">
Disabling this setting can lead to less accurate conversion measurements.
</div>

- **Disable Ad Personalization**: Enable this setting to programmatically disable ad personalization. Refer to the [Google Ads documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs/display-features#disable_advertising_personalization) for more information.
- **Use device mode to send events**: As this is a web device mode-only destination, this setting is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.
- **Dynamic Remarketing**: Enable this setting to allow RudderStack to leverage Google Ads' Dynamic Remarketing feature for event tracking. [Dynamic Remarketing](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7305793) lets you tailor your ads based on your users' previous interactions with your website.
- **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate <Link to="/sources/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/consent-managers/onetrust/">OneTrust</Link> cookie consent groups to Google Ads.

## Track

You can make a <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track/">`track`</Link> call with the conversion name to RudderStack for a **Click Event Conversion** which will, in turn, send this data to Google Ads.

<div class="infoBlock">
RudderStack maps <code class="inline-code">properties.currency</code>, <code class="inline-code">properties.order_id</code>, and <code class="inline-code">properties.revenue</code> to Google Ads' <code class="inline-code">currency</code>, <code class="inline-code">transaction_id</code>, and <code class="inline-code">value</code> fields respectively. Note that this is applicable only when the <strong>Dynamic Remarketing</strong> setting is disabled in the dashboard.
</div>

A sample `track` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track('track conversion', {
  revenue: 125,
  currency: 'INR',
  order_id: 'order_1'
});
```

A sample `track` call after enabling the **Dynamic Remarketing** option in the RudderStack dashboard is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track('view_item', {
  'value': 998.55,
  'items': [{
      'id': 1234,
      'google_business_vertical': 'retail'
    },
    {
      'id': 45678,
      'google_business_vertical': 'retail'
    }
  ]
});
```

<div class="successBlock">
The format for passing the parameters is quite flexible. You can use the standard Google format for tracking specific categories or use a custom format for tracking custom categories.
</div>

A sample `track` call for a custom event is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("custom_event", {
  custom_parameter1: "1",
  custom_parameter2: 2,
});
```

## Page

You can make a <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/page/">`page`</Link> call with the conversion name to RudderStack for a **Page Load Conversion** which will, in turn, send this data to Google Ads.

A sample `page` call is as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page('page view');
```

A sample `page` call for a custom event after enabling the **Dynamic Remarketing** option in RudderStack is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page("custom_event", {
  custom_parameter1: "1",
  custom_parameter2: 2,
});
```

As seen in the above snippet, enabling Dynamic Remarketing allows you to send custom parameters in the `page` call.

## FAQ

### How do I get the Conversion ID?

You can get the conversion ID from your global site tag snippet. For example, a sample conversion ID would look like `AW-123456789`.

### How do I get the Conversion Label for Google Ads?

You can find the value of the **Conversion Label** from your event snippet. For example, a event snippet would look like `send_to: 'AW-123456789/bpg3CMiIjLMBELXBp8wC'`. The Conversion Label here is `bpg3CMiIjLMBELXBp8wC`.
