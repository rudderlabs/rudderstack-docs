[LiveChat](https://www.livechat.com/) is a live chat software and customer service platform. It lets you manage user interactions across multiple channels and deliver more effective customer service.

RudderStack supports LiveChat as a destination where you can seamlessly send your event data.

## Getting started

Before configuring LiveChat as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by LiveChat by referring to the table below:

| Connection Mode | Web | Mobile | Server |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Device mode | Supported | - | - |
| Cloud mode | -  | - | - |

<div class="infoBlock">
To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</Link> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to LiveChat, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **LiveChat**.
2. Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.

## Connection settings

To successfully configure LiveChat as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

- **License**: Enter your LiveChat license ID.

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on obtaining your LiveChat license ID, refer to the <Link to="#faq">FAQ</Link> section below.
</div>

- **Record Live Chat Events**: Enable this setting to allow RudderStack to automatically record your LiveChat interactions as `track` events.
  - **List of Events**: If **Record Live Chat Events** setting is enabled, enter the list of LiveChat interactions for RudderStack to track.
  - **Update Event Name in track call**: Use this setting to map the standard LiveChat callback events with custom event names.

## Identify

You can use the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify/">`identify`</Link> events to send all the user-related information to LiveChat.

RudderStack sends the various **optional** `identify` properties by calling the following LiveChat functions:

| RudderStack property | LiveChat function |
| :----| :-----|
| `context.traits.email` | [`set_customer_email`](https://developers.livechat.com/docs/extending-chat-widget/javascript-api#set-customer-email) | 
| `message.traits` | [`set_custom_variables`](https://developers.livechat.com/docs/extending-chat-widget/javascript-api#set-session-variables) | 
| `context.traits.name` | [`set_customer_name`](https://developers.livechat.com/docs/extending-chat-widget/javascript-api#set-customer-name) | 

<div class="infoBlock">
RudderStack also leverages the <code class="inline-code">userId</code> present in the event to set a custom variable called <code class="inline-code">User ID</code>.
</div>

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("1hKOmRA4GRlm", {
  name: "Alex Keener",
  email: "alex@example.com",
  cart_value: "cart",
  "order date": "05/21/2019"
});
```

## Track

If you enable the **Record Live Chat Events** dashboard setting, RudderStack records the LiveChat interactions and sends them as <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track/">`track`</Link> events. You can then view and analyze these events in the other tools (connected to the same source in RudderStack).

<div class="infoBlock">
RudderStack only tracks the CTA interactions specified in the <strong>List of Events</strong> field in the dashboard settings. If this setting is not specified, RudderStack tracks all the interactions specified in the <Link to="#supported-events">Supported events</Link> section below.
</div>
