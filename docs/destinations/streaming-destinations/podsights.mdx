| **Cloud mode**      |        -       |  -   |   -            |

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Podsights, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Podsights**.
2. Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.

</div>

- **Use device mode to send events**: As this is a <Link to="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">web device mode</Link>-only destination, this setting is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.

## Track

## Page

You can use the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/page">`page`</Link> call to record your website's page views with any additional information about the viewed page.

<div class="infoBlock">
You can also set custom attributes inside the <code class="inline-code">page</code> event properties.
</div>

RudderStack sends the `page` calls to Podsights as a `view` event.

A sample `page` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page("Home", "Clothes", {
  path: "/best-seller/1",
  referrer: "https://www.google.com/search?q=estore+bestseller",
  url: "https://www.estore.com/best-seller/1"
});
```

### Supported property mappings

RudderStack maps the following **optional** properties with the Podsights properties:

| RudderStack property | Podsights property | 
| :----------------- | :--------------- |
| `context.page.referrer` | `referrer` |
| `context.page.url` | `url` |
