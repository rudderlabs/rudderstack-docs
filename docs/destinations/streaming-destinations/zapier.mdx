2. Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.

- **Zap URL**: Enter your Zap URL. 

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on creating a Zap and obtaining the Zap URL, refer to the <Link to="#faq">FAQ</Link> section below.
</div>

- **Mapping Track Events to a particular Zap**: Use this setting to send the `track` events with the specified **Event Name** to the corresponding **Zap URL**.
- **Mapping Page/Screen Events to a particular Zap**: Use this setting to send the `page`/`screen` events with the specified **Event Name** to the corresponding **Zap URL**.

## Sending events to Zapier

<div class="infoBlock">
RudderStack supports sending only <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track/"><code class="inline-code">track</code></Link>, <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/page/"><code class="inline-code">page</code></Link>, and <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/screen/"><code class="inline-code">screen</code></Link> events to Zapier.
</div>

RudderStack does not transform or map any data before sending it to Zapier. It sends the raw event payloads to the specified **Zap URL** as is, without any modification.

You can also send specific `track`, `page`, or `screen` events to a particular Zap URL as mentioned in the <Link to="#connection-settings">Connection settings</Link> above.
