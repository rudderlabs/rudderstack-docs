[**Ometria**](https://ometria.com/) is a customer data and marketing platform. It leverages AI-powered insights and cross-channel marketing to help you create personalized experiences for your customers throughout their product journey.

RudderStack supports Ometria as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your customer data.

## Getting started

Before configuring Ometria as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Ometria by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Device mode** | - | - | - |
| **Cloud** **mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">
To learn more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</Link> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that your source platform supports sending events to Ometria, follow these steps:

* From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **Ometria**.
* Assign a name to the destination and click **Next**. You should then see the following screen:

<span class="imageTitle">Ometria</span>

### Connection Settings

This section details the connection settings required to configure Ometria as a destination in RudderStack.

* Enter your Ometria **API Token**.

<div class="infoBlock">

To get the Ometria API token, go to your your Ometria dashboard and navigate to **Settings** - **API Keys**. Then, click **New API Key**.
</div>

* Under **Contact Settings**, you can choose the **Marketing Optin** status from the dropdown list. By default, it is set to **Explicitly Opted Out**. The different options are:
  * **Explicitly Opted In**: The customer is eligible for marketing
  * **Explicitly Opted Out**: The customer is not eligible for marketing
  * **Not Specified**: No option is specified

<div class="infoBlock">

You can also pass this value in the `identify` call - refer to the **Identify** section below for more details. Note that the value set via the `identify` call will have a higher precedence.
</div>

* Under **SMS Channel Settings**, you can enable **Allow Marketing**. This setting determines whether the contact is opted in or out for SMS marketing. By default, it is **disabled**.
* **Allow Transactional**: Enabling or disabling this setting determines if the contact is opted in or out for transactional SMSes. By default, it is **disabled**.

<div class="infoBlock">

You can additionally set the values for **Allow Marketing** and **Allow Transactional** via the `identify` call - refer to the **Identify** section below for more details. Note that the value set via the `identify` call will have a higher precedence.
</div>

* Finally, click **Next**. Ometria will now be enabled as a destination in RudderStack.

## Identify

The `identify` call lets you add a new contact or update an already existing contact in Ometria.

<div class="warningBlock">

Note that `listingId` and `email` fields are the mandatory fields for the `identify` call.
</div>

You can set the values for the **Marketing Optin**, **Allow Marketing**, and **Allow Transactional** fields from RudderStack dashboard. You can also send these values using an `integrations` object in the `identify` event payload, **which will have higher precedence**. The SMS channel fields `dt_updated_marketing` and `dt_updated_transactional` can also be passed using this object.

The `listingId` is the ID specific to a contact in a particular Ometria collection. Note that the `listingId` specified in the `integrations` object will have a higher precedence than the one present in the traits.

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify(
  "userId",
  {
    listingId: "listingId123",
    email: "sampleuser@testmail.com",
    firstName: "Demo",
    lastName: "Example",
    phoneNumber: "+123451212260",
    custom_fields: {
      field1: "val1",
    }
  },
  {
    integrations: {
      Ometria: {
        marketingOptin: "EXPLICITLY_OPTEDIN",
        allow_marketing: true,
        allow_transactional: true,
      }
    }
  }
);
```

A few things to keep in mind while making the `identify` call:

* The `phoneNumber` field must follow the [**E.164**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) format. Otherwise, it will be set to `null`.
* The `custom_fields` are mapped to the `properties` and will be the used in the `track` call too.
* If `custom_fields` is not provided, then RudderStack will create that object with extra fields. Note that these fields must be different from the ones mentioned in the mapping list mentioned in the **Identify Mapping** section below, i.e, the non-default fields.
* Inside the `integrations` object, you can additionally send two timestamps - `dt_updated_marketing` and `dt_updated_transactional`. These timestamps must follow the [**ISO-8601**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format.

### Identify Mapping

The following table includes all `identify` fields with their relative mapping to the Ometria fields:

| **RudderStack Field** | **Ometria Field** |
| :--- | :--- |
| `userId` / `anonymousId` | `customer_id` |
| `email` | `email` |
| `listingId` | `id` |
| `firstName`/`first_name`/`firstname` | `firstname` |
| `middleName`/ `middle_name` / `middlename` | `middlename` |
| `lastName`/`last_name`/`lastname` | `lastname` |
| `phoneNumber` | `phone_number` |
| `collection` | `@collection` |
| `prefix` | `prefix` |
| `dateOfBirth` | `date_of_birth` |
| `countryId` | `country_id` |
| `timezone` | `timezone` |
| `timestampAcquired` | `timestamp_acquired` |
| `timestampSubscribed` | `timestamp_subscribed` |
| `timestampUnsubscribed` | `timestamp_unsubscribed` |
| `storeIds` | `store_ids` |
| `gender` | `gender` |
| `removeFromLists` | `@remove_from_lists` |
| `addToLists` | `@add_to_lists` |
| `custom_fields` | `properties` |
| `forceOptin` | `@force_optin` |
| `merge` | `@merge` |

<div class="infoBlock">

In addition to the above fields, the customer name can also be sent using the `name` field. If the name consists of two words, then `firstname` and `lastname` will be automatically set.
</div>

## Track

The `track` call lets you send custom events to Ometria. Note that `track` also supports the E-Commerce events and sends them using the **Ometria Order Object**.

<div class="warningBlock">

Note that `userId` and `email` are the mandatory fields for the `track` call. `event_id` is required for custom events. If not provided, RudderStack will populate the field with `messageId`.
</div>

A sample `track` call for a custom event is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Sample Event", {
  event_id: "sample123",
  timestamp: "2017-05-01T14:00:00Z",
  profile_id: "sample",
  custom_fields: {
    field1: "val1",
  },
});
```

A few things to note:

* The event name must be provided in the `track` call.
* The `custom_fields` property is mapped to the `properties` object in Ometria. If it is not provided, the non-default Ometria fields will be taken as custom fields.
* The `timestamp` field follows the [**ISO-8601**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format. If it is not specified in the correct format, the call will be dropped - i.e., not be sent to Ometria.

### Ometria Custom Event

The following table includes all the RudderStack fields set as custom events in the `track` call, with their relative mapping to the Ometria fields:

| **RudderStack Field** | **Ometria Field** |
| :--- | :--- |
| `event_id` | `id` |
| `timestamp` | `timestamp` |
| `custom_fields` | `properties` |
| `profile_id` | `profile_id` |
| `email` | `identity_email` |
| `userId / anonymousId` | `identity_account_id` |

### E-Commerce Events

The `track` call also lets you record order-related information like `order_id`, `grandtotal`, `timestamp`, `currency`, etc.

RudderStack will create a `customer` object with `userId`, `email`, `firstname` and `lastname` from `context.traits`.

<div class="warningBlock">

Note that `order_id`, `timestamp`, `grand_total` and `currency` are the mandatory fields for the `orders` event, while `userId` and `email` are required for `customer` object. You can pass `email` either via the `identify` call or the `track` call's properties.
</div>

The supported `order` E-Commerce events are as listed below:

* `order completed` / `complete`/ `order complete`
* `order shipped` / `shipped`
* `order pending` / `pending`

A sample `track` call for an E-Commerce order event is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("order completed", {
  order_id: "order1",
  timestamp: "2017-05-01T14:00:00Z",
  currency: "usd",
  grand_total: 1,
  field1: "val1",
  products: [
    {
      product_id: "prod123",
      quantity: 4,
      subtotal: 10,
      variant_options:[
        {
          type: "size",
          id: "newid",
          label: "5"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
});
```

A few things to note:

* Ometria requires the `currency` field to follow the [**ISO 4217**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) format. If it is invalid, the event will be **dropped**.
* If `custom_fields` is not provided, the non-default fields are taken as custom fields. In the above example, `field1` will be mapped as a `custom_fields`.
* The `products` field is **not mandatory**. However, if provided, each object should contain `product_id`, `quantity`, and either `subtotal` or `unit_price`. If either of these fields are absent, then that object will be dropped and the `track` call will be made.
* RudderStack will set the `status` field according to the event name. For instance, if event name is `order pending` status will be set to `pending`.
* The field `is_valid` is always set to `true`. For more information on how to use this field, refer to this [**example**](https://docs.ometria.com/recipes/how-to-process-a-full-refund).
