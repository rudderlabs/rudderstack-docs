description: Send events to Lemnisk using RudderStack web device mode.
---

RudderStack lets you send your event data to Lemnisk via the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">device mode</Link> using the native web SDK.

## Identify

You can use the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify">`identify`</Link> call to assocaite a user to their activities and capture relevant traits about them. These traits could be a user ID, email, name etc. Once you call the `identify` event via Rudderstack, Lemnisk [`identify`](https://lemnisk.gitbook.io/lemnisk-platform-documentation/events/identify) event will be triggered. Lemnisk needs a unique user ID to associate an event with a user. By default, we will use our cookie to identify the user. Optionally, a unique user ID can be passed in the first parameter.

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("hashed_user_id", {
  name: "Name Surname",
  email: "sample@example.com",
})
```

### Supported mappings

The following table lists the RudderStack attributes and their mappings with the Lemnisk properties:

| RudderStack property   | Lemnisk property  | 
| :-------------| :-----------------| 
|   <span style="color: #4D4DFF;font-size:12px;">Required</span> | `userId` |
| `traits` | `customerProperties` |

## Track

The `track` API call records the actions that the users perform, along with the properties of the action. Each action is called an event. Each event has a name and some properties associated with it along with an optional callback function. For example, the event name could be `productViewed`, while the properties can be `sort`, `currencyCode` etc. Once you call the `track` event via Rudderstack, Lemnisk [`track`](https://lemnisk.gitbook.io/lemnisk-platform-documentation/events/track) event will be triggered.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Product Reviewed", {
  review_id: "12345",
  product_id: "123",
  rating: 3.0,
  review_body: "Average product, expected much more."
})
```

The following table lists the RudderStack properties and their mappings with the Lemnisk properties:

| RudderStack property   | Lemnisk property  | 
| :-------------| :-----------------| 
| `event` <br/> <span style="color: #4D4DFF;font-size:12px;">Required</span> | `event` |
| `properties`  | `properties` |
|  | `userId` |

## Page

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/page/">`page`</Link> call lets you record when a user views a page of your website, along with any optional properties about the page. Once you call the `page` event via Rudderstack, Lemnisk [`page`](https://lemnisk.gitbook.io/lemnisk-platform-documentation/events/page) event will be triggered.

A sample `page` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page("Home")
```

The following table lists the RudderStack properties and their mappings with the Lemnisk properties:

| RudderStack property   | Lemnisk property  | 
| :-------------| :-----------------|
