RudderStack lets you send your event data to Rockerbox via the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode">cloud mode</Link>.

<div class="infoBlock">
Find the open source transformer code for this destination in the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/v0/destinations/ga4">GitHub repository</a>.
</div>

## Track

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track">`track`</Link> call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(
  "Order Completed", {
    revenue: 30,
    currency: "USD",
    user_actual_id: 12345 
  })
```

<div class="infoBlock">
You can choose to send either <code class="inline-code">email</code> or <code class="inline-code">customer_id</code> depending on your implementation. However, it is recommended to include both if available.
</div>
