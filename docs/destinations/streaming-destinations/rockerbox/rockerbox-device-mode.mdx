description: Detailed technical documentation on sending events to Rockerbox using the RudderStack Web Device mode.

RudderStack lets you send your event data to Rockerbox destination via the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">device mode</Link> using the native web SDK.

## Identify

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify/">`identify`</Link> call lets you identify a visiting user and associate them to their actions. It also lets you record the traits about them like their name, email address, etc.

User-ID is an advanced feature that lets GA4 present a cross-device, cross-platform view of your customers' behavior. Rockerbox uses `userId` and `deviceId` \(GA's `cid` value from Universal Analytics terminology\) to identify users.

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("sampleuser101", {
    "email": "sampleuser101@rudder.com"
})
```


| RudderStack    | Rockerbox  | 
| :-------------| :-----------------|
| external_id     | `userId`        |
| email        | `traits.email or context.traits.email`        |
| phone_number        | `traits.phone || context.traits?.phone`    |

This user ID should be a true first-party identifier that persists across sessions. Often, this is an ID for a user that is logged in. Having a unique user ID in a conversion pixel is essential for capturing new/returning user data. You are welcome to include as many user identifiers as you'd like, but only the true first-party identifier should be passed to Rockerbox as external_id.

## Track

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track">`track`</Link> call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.

A sample `track` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(
    "Product Added", {
        product_id: "00000",
        product_name: "Pink bolognas",
        product_url: "http://www.yourdomain.com/products/pink-bolognas",
    })
```

We can also track conversion events. For this, we have to create a conversion tag by removing the view tracking event and replace it with a conversion event. Example for purchase conversion event

Other standard conversion event types supported are:

- conv.purchase
- conv.add_to_cart
- conv.initiate_checkout
- conv.create_account
- conv.email_signup
- conv.enrollment

## Page
  
The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/page">`page`</Link> call lets you record your website's page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.

Rockerbox `gtag` sends a `page_view` event to Google Analytics by default every-time it is loaded. You can also send `page_view` event to Google Analytics whenever you make an explicit `page()` call to RudderStack SDK.

RudderStack sends the following properties by default:

- `path` mapped to `page_location`
- `title` mapped to `page_title`
- `referrer` mapped to `page_referrer`

You can also make `page()` call with any custom and standard properties as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page(
    "Cart",
    "Cart Viewed", {
        title: "new blank page",
        url: "/pages/new"
    }
);
```
