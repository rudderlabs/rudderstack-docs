description: Detailed technical documentation on sending events to Rockerbox using the RudderStack Web Device mode.

RudderStack lets you send your event data to Rockerbox destination via the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">device mode</Link> using the native web SDK. 

<div class="infoBlock">
Find the open source JavaScript SDK code for this destination in the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-js/tree/production/integrations/Rockerbox">GitHub repository</a>.
</div>

## Identify

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify/">`identify`</Link> call lets you identify a visiting user and associate them to their actions. It also lets you record the traits about them like their name, email address, etc.

In order to setup webhooks, we need to fire an [Identify Pixel](https://help.rockerbox.com/article/opr65u0v3j-identify-calls) with corresponding user data whenever the user is authenticated on your website. It is required to match users from the webhook to onsite activity.

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("sampleuser101", {
    "email": "sampleuser101@rudder.com"
})
```

The following table lists the property mappings between RudderStack and Rockerbox:

| RudderStack property   | Rockerbox property  | 
| :-------------| :-----------------|
| `userId` | `external_id`     |     
| `traits.email`/`context.traits.email`        | `email`        | 
| `traits.phone`/`context.traits?.phone`    | `phone_number`        | 

<div class="infoBlock">
The <code class="inline-code">userId</code> is the ID for a logged in user. It is a first-party identifier that persists across sessions. A unique user ID is essential in a conversion pixel for capturing new or returning user's data. You can include as many user identifiers, but only the first-party identifier should be passed to Rockerbox as <code class="inline-code">external_id</code>.
</div>

## Track

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track">`track`</Link> call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.

A sample `track` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(
    "Product Added", {
        product_id: "00000",
        product_name: "Pink bolognas",
        product_url: "http://www.yourdomain.com/products/pink-bolognas",
    })
```

You can also track conversion events by creating a conversion tag. Removing the view tracking event and replace it with a conversion event. The following standard conversion event types are supported:

- `conv.purchase`
- `conv.add_to_cart`
- `conv.initiate_checkout`
- `conv.create_account`
- `conv.email_signup`
- `conv.enrollment`

## Page
  
The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/page">`page`</Link> call lets you record your website's page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.

The page call is associated with `RB.track("view");` event. Whatever is passed in properties, will be passed onto Rockerbox.

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page(
    "Cart",
    "Cart Viewed", {
        title: "new blank page",
        url: "/pages/new"
    }
);
```
