## Events

Courier destination supports identify and track events.

### Identify

You can sync users from RudderStack to Courier using identify calls.

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify('janedoe', {
  name: 'Jane Doe',
  country: 'United States',
  email: 'janedoe@example.com',
})
```

User will be synced into Courier, which should be visible on Courier <a href="https://app.courier.com/users">Users</a> page or accessible via Courier APIs

Future identify calls with the same userId will update the profile that was already created.

### Track

Track call lets you ingest events into Courier, which can be mapped to <a href="https://www.courier.com/features/automations/">Courier Automations</a>.

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track('Cart checkout', {
  product: 'shoe-123',
  // additional properties
})
```

Events will appear on Courier Studio on the <a href="https://app.courier.com/channels/rudderstack">Rudderstack</a> integration page.

For instance, below is the example of `Cart checkout` event mapped to `Send shipping details` automation.
