description: Step-by-step guide on sending your event data from RudderStack to FullStory
---

[**FullStory**](https://www.fullstory.com/) is a platform for analyzing user interactions, data recording and searching, and much more. FullStory's Digital Experience Intelligence (DXI) capability lets you measure and improve your users' overall digital experience.

RudderStack supports FullStory as a destination to which you can send your event data seamlessly.

## Getting started

To send your events to FullStory via RudderStack, you will first need to add it as a destination in the RudderStack dashboard. Before you get started, check if the source platform supports sending events to FullStory by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server** |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :--------- |
| **Device mode**     | **Supported** | **Supported** | -          |
| **Cloud mode**      | -             | -             | -          |

<div class="infoBlock">
To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</Link> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the platform supports sending events to FullStory, perform the steps below:

- From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, select **FullStory** from the list of destinations.
- Assign a name to your destination and click on **Next**. You should be able to see the following screen:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/fullstory-connection-settings.png" alt="FullStory connection settings" />

### Connection settings

To configure the destination, you will need to enter the following settings:

- **FS ORG**: To get this value, log into your FullStory account and navigate to **Settings** - **General**. Then, copy the value present in the following line:

```
window['_fs_org'] = 'some_value';
```

In the above snippet, `some_value` represents the value for the **FS ORG** field.

- To enable FullStory debugging, you can enable the **FS debug mode** option.

## Adding device mode integration

To add FullStory to your project, follow the steps below depending on your platform of integration.

### iOS

To add FullStory to your iOS project, follow these steps:

* In your `Podfile`, add the following dependencies:

```ruby
pod 'FullStory', :http => 'https://ios-releases.fullstory.com/fullstory-1.18.0-xcframework.tar.gz'
pod 'Rudder-FullStory', :git => 'https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-integration-fullstory-ios.git', :tag => 'v1.0.0'
```

* After adding the dependencies followed by a `pod install` command, add the following imports to your `AppDelegate.m` file:

```objectivec
#import <Rudder/Rudder.h>
#import <RudderFullStoryFactory.h>
```

* Then, initialize your `RSClient` as shown:

```objectivec
RSConfigBuilder *configBuilder = [[RSConfigBuilder alloc] init];
[configBuilder withDataPlaneUrl:dataPlaneUrl];
[configBuilder withFactory:[RudderFullStoryFactory instance]];
RSClient *rudderClient = [RSClient getInstance:writeKey config:[configBuilder build]];
```

To complete the FullStory integration, you need to specify which FullStory organization to record. Follow these steps:

* Open your app's `Info.plist`.

* From the menu, choose <b>Editor</b> - <b>Add Item</b>. Set the key name to `FullStory`, and the type to `Dictionary`.

* Right-click on the FullStory row, and choose <b>Add Row</b>. Set the key name to `OrgId`, and the type to `String`. For the value, paste your assigned organization ID.

* When configured correctly, the `Info.plist` entry should look as follows:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/fullstory-devicemode-ios.png" alt="Final entry"/>

</div>

### Android

To add FullStory to your Android project, follow these steps:

* Open your `app/build.gradle` (Module: app) file and add the following under the `dependencies` section:

```groovy
implementation 'com.rudderstack.android.sdk:core:1.0.22'
implementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:fullstory:1.0.0'
implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.6'
// FullStory
repositories {
  maven { url "https://maven.fullstory.com" }
}
implementation 'com.fullstory:instrumentation-full:1.18.0@aar'
```

* Then, add the FullStory Maven plugin to your build script. To do so, add the following snippet into the `Gradle Scripts` section of your root `build.gradle`:

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    google()
    jcenter()
    maven { url "https://maven.fullstory.com" }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.fullstory:gradle-plugin-local:PLUGIN_VERSION'
    // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong
    // in the individual module build.gradle files
  }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

* Make sure that you replace `PLUGIN_VERSION` with the correct version of the FullStory Android plugin. You can find the latest release notes <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRBDZpgGoLz2IdHntpXtS_1HWGMwlf6n1J1SurkcyguQB9Liv9OCQ1LHnNmfhxwcZ-ZQSl7QUgcMIR5/pub">here</a> (this is currently 1.18.0).

* To apply the FullStory plugin, add the following snippet into your app-specific `build.gradle` (if your Gradle file adds plugins via plugin ID):

```groovy
plugins {
  id 'com.android.application'
  id 'fullstory'
}
fullstory {
  org 'YOUR_ORG_ID_HERE'
}
```

* If your Gradle file applies plugins, use the following snippet instead:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/fullstory-devicemode-android.png" alt="Final entry"/>

<div class="infoBlock">
  
  Replace <code class="inline-code">YOUR_ORG_ID_HERE</code> above with your organization ID.
</div>

* To apply FullStory to all variants, including those used at debug time, add the following line below `org`:

```groovy
org 'YOUR_ORG_ID_HERE'
enabledVariants 'all'
```

* Add the following permissions, if not added already, to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```markup
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>
```

* Finally, initialize the RudderStack SDK in your `Application` class' `onCreate()` method as shown:

```kotlin
// initializing Rudder SDK
val rudderClient = RudderClient.getInstance(
  this,
  WRITE_KEY,
  RudderConfig.Builder()
          .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)
          .withFactory(FullStoryIntegrationFactory.FACTORY)
          .build()
  )
```

## Identify

The `identify` call is used to uniquely identify a user in FullStory.

A sample `identify` call looks like the following snippet:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("userId", {
  name: "John",
  email: "john@xyz.com",
});
```

The above call is translated to a FullStory `identify` call as follows:

- `userId` is sent as the `uid` .
- The remaining traits are passed on as is.

<div class="infoBlock">

In the web device mode, if the <code class="inline-code">userId</code> is not explicitly provided, then the <code class="inline-code">anonymousId</code> of the user is sent as the <code class="inline-code">uid</code> instead.
</div>

### `displayName` and `email`

`displayName` and `email` are both **optional** traits that can passed on to FullStory and are treated specially. Once these traits are specified in the `identify` call, they will show up automatically the next time the user list is browsed in FullStory.

A sample `identify` call using the `displayName` and `email` is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("1234", {
  displayName: "John Falko",
  email: "john@xyz.com",
  country: "UK",
});
```

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the <code class="inline-code">displayName</code> and <code class="inline-code">email</code> traits, refer to the <a href="https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020828113">FullStory documentation</a>.
</div>

## Track

A `track` call lets you track custom events as they occur in your web application.

A sample `track` call looks like the following snippet:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Order Completed", {
  orderId: "1234567",
  price: "567",
  currency: "USD",
});
```

A `track` call is directly passed on to FullStory via its [**FS.event**](https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020623274-FS-event-API-Sending-custom-event-data-into-FullStory) method. All the associated event properties are also passed to FullStory via this call.

## Page

A `page` call contains information such as the URL or the name of the web page visited by the user.

By default, all `page` calls are sent to FullStory as events. A sample `page` call looks like the following:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page("homepage");
```

The above call sends an event to FullStory with a name `Viewed a Page`. It also sends the following properties with the event:

- `name` \*if provided \(`homepage` in the sample example above\)
- `path`
- `referrer`
- `search`
- `title`
- `url`

Any additional properties passed to the `page` call are also passed on to FullStory.

## Screen

The `screen` method allows you to record whenever a user sees the mobile screen, along with any associated optional properties. This call is similar to the `page` call, but exclusive to your mobile device.

A sample `screen` call looks like the following code snippet:

```kotlin
MainApplication.rudderClient.screen("Sample Screen Name",
            RudderProperty()
                .putValue("prop_key","prop_value"));
```

In the above snippet, RudderStack captures all the information related to the viewed screen, along with any additional info associated with that event. In FullStory, the above `screen` call will be shown as - `Screen Viewed` along with the properties.

<div class="infoBlock">

Note that the <code class="inline-code">screen</code> call will be sent to FullStory as a custom event.
</div>

## Reset

The `reset` method calls will release the identity of the current user and create a new anonymous session. It should be called when the users log out. For more information, refer to the [**FullStory Reset API**](https://developer.fullstory.com/anonymize?lang=ObjectiveC).

A sample `reset` call for iOS is as shown:

```objectivec
[[RSClient sharedInstance] reset];
```

For Android, a sample `reset` call is shown below:

```kotlin
MainApplication.rudderClient.reset()
````

## FAQs

### How do I get the value for the field FS ORG?

To get the value for the **FS ORG \*** field in the RudderStack **Connection Settings**, please follow these steps:

1. Login to your FullStory dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Settings** - **General**.
3. Go to the following line and copy the value present there: `window['_fs_org'] = 'fullstory_org';`
    
In this case, `fullstory_org` is your **FS ORG** value.

### How do I prevent FullStory from automatically recording on startup?

By default, FullStory will automatically request a session and start recording on the app's startup. If you need to start recording the app only when certain conditions are met, then you can use the new `RecordOnStart` feature. Configuring FullStory to disable `RecordOnStart` will prevent any recording until you explicitly invoke `FS.restart`. 

To prevent FullStory from recording on start, follow these steps:

In your iOS app’s `Info.plist`'s FullStory dictionary, add a `RecordOnStart` key of type `Boolean` with a value of `NO`. Refer to the [**FullStory iOS documentation**](https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042772333-Getting-Started-with-iOS-Recording#01ER0FEDVJS9RJ843477QPRYS6) for more information.

In case of Android, go to your FullStory plugin configuration (where you set your organiation ID) and set the following:

```groovy
fullstory {
org 'YOUR_ORG_ID_HERE'
recordOnStart false
}
```

Refer to the [**FullStory Android documentation**](https://help.fullstory.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040596093-Getting-Started-with-Android-Recording#01F5E7XY5HJYV5ZWCCSYNQ8TXC) for more information.

### How do I subclass from an application in Android?

FullStory requires that you enable MultiDex. If your minSdkVersion is set to 21 or higher, Multidex is enabled by default. In this case, you will need to extend `android.app.Application`, otherwise there will be a build error. If your minSdkVersion is lower than 21, you will need to subclass from `androidx.multidex.MultiDexApplication` instead.

If you're using Java and if you do not have an application class, you will need to create one. In your `App.java`, add the following:

```java
import android.app.Application;
public class App extends Application {
...
}
```

If you're using Kotlin and if you do not have an application class, you will need to create one, and add the following in your `App.kt`:

```kotlin
import android.app.Application
class App: Application() {
...
}
```

Then, set `android:name="App"` in your `AndroidManifest.xml` under the `<application>` tag as shown:

```xml
<application
android:name="App" ….
```
         
### I encountered this error: Build was configured to prefer settings repositories over project repositories but repository 'Google' was added by build file 'build.gradle'. What do I do?

Go to your `settings.gradle` file located in the root, and then comment or remove this line: `repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)` as shown in the following snippet:

```groovy
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    // repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        jcenter() // Warning: this repository is going to shut down soon
    }
}
rootProject.name = "FullStory_Sample_App"
include ':app'
```
