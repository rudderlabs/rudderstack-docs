| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :----- | :----- |
| **Device Mode**     | **Supported** | **-**  | **-**  |

2. Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on obtaining the Pinterest Tag ID, refer to the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section below.

- **Enable hashing for user data conversions**: This setting is enabled by default and hashes your user data using SHA256 encoding.
- **Enable Event Deduplication**: Enable this setting to deduplicate the events. If enabled, you need to enter the following:
  - **Deduplication key**: Enter the key using which Pinterest Tag should use to deduplicate the events.

- **Custom Properties**: Enter any custom properties which should be sent to Pinterest. This field is **applicable only** for sending events to Pinterest Tag via <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">device mode</Link>.

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on using the custom properties, refer to the <Link to="/destinations/streaming-destinations/pinterest-ads/pinterest-ads-device-mode/#custom-properties">Custom properties</Link> section.
</div>

- **Map Your Events To Pinterest Events**: Use this field to map RudderStack events to Pinterest Standard Conversion Events.

<div class="infoBlock">
<ul>
<li> The event mapping specified in the above connection setting is given the highest priority.</li>
<li> If not specified, the <Link to="/destinations/streaming-destinations/pinterest-ads/pinterest-ads-device-mode/#e-commerce-conversion-tracking">standard e-commerce event mapping</Link> is considered.</li>
<li> If none of the above qualifies, RudderStack sends the event name as is, and it is shown as an <code class="inline-code">unknown</code> event in the Pinterest dashboard.</li>
</ul>
</div>


- **Enable Enhanced Match on Page Load**: This setting is enabled by default and attaches the hashed email address on the initial page load. Any further calls made to Pinterest will be an Enhanced Match.

  When disabled, all the visits made to your site become anonymous. However, you can still identify any user by making the `identify()` call.

  RudderStack supports [Pinterest Enhanced Match](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/enhanced-match) when the following conditions are met:

  - A user is identified every time they visit your site.
  - A user visits your site anonymously but is identified at a later stage by making an `identify()` call.

  If you use RudderStack's `identify()` method to enable Pinterestâ€™s Enhanced Match, you can only collect this information for successive events. Pinterest does not retroactively update the values for the past events.
