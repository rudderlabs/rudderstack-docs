RudderStack lets you send your event data to Pinterest Tag using Pinterest's `pintrk` conversion tag via the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">device mode</Link>.


a using Pinterest's `pintrk` conversion tag.

Find the open source JavaScript SDK code for this destination in the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-js/tree/production/integrations/PinterestTag">GitHub repository</a>.
</div>


## Identify

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify">`identify`</Link> call lets you create new or update existing customers and record the traits about them like their name, email address, etc. 

When you make an `identify` call with a userâ€™s email address and traits, RudderStack triggers the Pinterest `set()` method. This saves the identification parameters to be sent with the next events, so it is recommended to set the values as early as possible. 

If you make an `identify` call without `email`, the identification parameter will not be set.

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm", {
  name: "Alex Keener",
  email: "alex@example.com",
})
```

In the above example, the identification parameter will be set to `alex@example.com` and the successive calls will be an Enhanced Match.

<div class="infoBlock">
After an <code class="inline-code">identify</code> call is made, nothing appears in the network tab in your browser or in the tag helper extension. However, a hashed value for an <code class="inline-code">em</code> parameter is added in the next event call, in a JSON object encoded in the URL.
</div>

## Track

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track">`track`</Link> call allows you to capture user actions along with the properties associated with these actions.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Order Completed", {
    checkout_id: "C324532",
    order_id: "T1230",
    value: 15.98,
    revenue: 16.98,
    currency: "INR"
})
```

RudderStack SDK sends the `track` event and any properties as custom properties to Pinterest.

### E-commerce conversion tracking

RudderStack supports e-commerce conversion tracking for Pinterest. You can use the <Link to="/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/">E-commerce Events Specification</Link> guide for sending the events while instrumenting your site with the RudderStack SDK.

The following table mentions some sample `track` events mapped to the Pinterest events:

| RudderStack event | Pinterest event  |
| :--------------------- | :------------------- |
| Order Completed        | `Checkout`           |
| Product Added          | `AddToCart`          |
| Products Searched      | `Search`             |
| Product List Filtered    | `Search`           |

You can also track a custom event that you want to include in the conversion reporting. It will be mapped to a custom Pinterest event, for example:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("custom event")
```

<div class="infoBlock">
You can map your event to a specific Pinterest event by adding it in the <strong>Map Your Events To Pinterest Events</strong> section while configuring the Pinterest destination in RudderStack.
</div>

### Standard Pinterest events

Pinterest supports the following nine standard events that can be mapped and tracked for reporting. Any event apart from these is treated as a user-defined event.

- `Checkout`
- `AddToCart`
- `PageVisit`
- `SignUp`
- `WatchVideo`
- `Lead`
- `Search`
- `ViewCategory`
- `Custom`

### Property mapping

Rudderstack maps the following properties to the Pinterest properties:

| RudderStack property | Pinterest property |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------- |
| query                     | `search_query`          |
| value                     | `value`                 |
| order_quantity            | `order_quantity`        |
| currency                  | `currency`              |
| order_id                  | `order_id`              |
| promo_code                | `promo_code`            |
| property                  | `property`              |
| video_title               | `video_title`           |
| lead_type                 | `lead_type`             |
| coupon                    | `coupon`                |

The following properties are nested within the e-commerce `products` array:

| RudderStack property  | Pinterest property  |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------- |
| product_id                | `product_id`            |
| sku                       | `product_id`            |
| name                      | `product_name`          |
| price                     | `product_price`         |
| category                  | `product_category`      |
| variant                   | `product_variant`       |
| quantity                  | `product_quantity`      |
| brand                     | `product_brand`         |

### Custom properties

You can send the custom properties to Pinterest by adding them in the **Custom Properties** section while configuring the Pinterest destination in RudderStack.

A sample snippet with custom properties is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Event", {
  customProperty: {
    customValue: 2,
  },
  someRandomMailId: "user@gmail.com",
})
```

For the above snippet, the following properties must be added in the **Custom Properties** section:
- `customProperty.customValue`
- `someRandomMailId`

## Page

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/page">`page`</Link> call lets you record your website's page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.

Pinterest's `pintrk` conversion tag sends any one of the following events when you make a `page` call:

- **`ViewCategory`**: RudderStack sends this event if both the `name` and `category` fields are present. The below sample event contains both the fields and is mapped to the Pinterest's `ViewCategory` event:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page("Best Seller", "Games", {
  path: "/best-seller/games/1",
  url: "https://www.estore.com/best-seller/games/1",
  title: "Best selling games offered by EStore",
  search: "estore bestseller games",
  referrer: "https://www.google.com/search?q=estore+bestseller",
  testDimension: "true",
})
```
- **`PageVisit`**: RudderStack sends this event if only `name` field is present and drops any additional properties. The below sample event contains only `name` and is mapped to the Pinterest's `PageVisit` event:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page("Best Seller", {
  path: "/best-seller/1",
})
```
