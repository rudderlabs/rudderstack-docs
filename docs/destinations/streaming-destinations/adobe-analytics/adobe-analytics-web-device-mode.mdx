<div class="infoBlock">
Find the open source JavaScript SDK code for this destination in the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-js/tree/production/src/integrations/AdobeAnalytics">GitHub repository</a>.
</div>

## Initialization

We initialize [`appmeasurement.js`](https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/adobe-analytics-js/adobe-analytics-js.js) or [`mediaSDK.js`](https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/adobe-analytics-js/adobe-analytics-js-heartbeat.js) according to the settings in the RudderStack dashboard.

RudderStack first checks if any global properties are set in `window.s_account` or `window.s objects`. If already present, they will be used. Otherwise, RudderStack uses the Report Suite IDs, Tracking Server URL, and Tracking Server Secure URL \(optional\) as set in the RudderStack dashboard.

<div class="infoBlock">
Refer to the <Link to="/destinations/streaming-destinations/adobe-analytics/setting-up-adobe-analytics-in-rudderstack/#connection-settings">Dashboard Settings</Link> guide for more information on these settings.
</div>

If Marketing Cloud Organization ID is set in the dashboard, RudderStack initializes `visitorApi.js` and sets the ID in `window.Visitor.getInstance(<Your Marketing Cloud Org Id>)`.

## Page

RudderStack sends a page view event to Adobe Analytics whenever you make a **`page()`** call.

A sample `page` call is as shown:

```javascript
// Passing page category, name and properties
rudderanalytics.page("category", "name", {
  path: "path",
  url: "url",
  title: "title",
  search: "search",
  referrer: "referrer",
})
```

If this call is made the `pageName` of the `window.s` variable will be set as **Viewed Page name**. RudderStack also sends other information like `referrer`,`url`, etc.

<div class="infoBlock">
The mappings done in the RudderStack dashboard will be set as context data, eVars, hiers, lists and props for every <code class="inline-code">page</code> call. The <code class="inline-code">t()</code> method is called to compile all the variables set and send them to Adobe Analytics.
</div>

## Track

According to the mapping done in RudderStack, the events can be sent as particular Adobe Events.

The `track` events for Adobe can be broadly categorized in 3 types:

1. Normal track events
2. E-Commerce track events
3. Video type \(Heartbeat\) track events

<div class="infoBlock">
For the regular and video type (Heartbeat) <code class="inline-code">track</code> events, it is necessary to map the events in the RudderStack dashboard.
</div>

For the E-Commerce track events, if the events fall under the following mapping they will be sent accordingly. Otherwise, the mapping should be done in the dashboard.

<div class="infoBlock">
For more info on the RudderStack E-Commerce Spec, follow the <Link to="/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/">Ecommerce Events Specification</Link> guide.
</div>

The mapping is as shown:

| Rudder ecommerce event | Adobe event  |
| :---------------------- | :----------- |
| `product viewed`        | `prodView`   |
| `product list viewed`   | `prodView`   |
| `product added`         | `scAdd`      |
| `product removed`       | `scRemove`   |
| `order completed`       | `purchase`   |
| `cart viewed`           | `scView`     |
| `checkout started`      | `scCheckout` |
| `cart opened`           | `scOpen`     |
| `opened cart`           | `scOpen`     |

A sample `track` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Track me", {
  category: "category",
  label: "label",
  value: "value",
})
```
