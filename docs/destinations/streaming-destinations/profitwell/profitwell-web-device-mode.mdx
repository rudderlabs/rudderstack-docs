RudderStack lets you send your event data to ProfitWell via the web <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">device mode</Link>, that is, using the native web SDK.

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on sending events via the Device mode, refer to the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</Link> guide.
</div>

## Getting started

RudderStack supports sending event data to ProfitWell via the following <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">connection modes</a>:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Device mode** | **Supported** | - | - |
| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">
In the web device mode integration, that is, using <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk">JavaScript SDK</Link> as a source, the ProfitWell native SDK is loaded from <code class="inline-code">https://public.profitwell.com/</code> domain. Based on your website's content security policy, you might need to <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain">allowlist this domain</Link> to load the ProfitWell SDK successfully.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to ProfitWell, follow the steps below:

* From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **ProfitWell**.
* Assign a name to the destination, and click on **Next**. You will then see the following **Connection Settings** window:

### Connection Settings

To successfully configure ProfitWell as a Device Mode destination, enter the following connection settings:

* **Public API Key**: Enter your ProfitWell public API key here. To obtain the **Public API Key**, log into your ProfitWell account. Then, navigate to the **Account Settings** - **Integration** option. Here, you can get your API key under [**API Keys/Dev Kit**](https://www2.profitwell.com/app/account/integrations), as shown in the following image:

<div class="infoBlock">

The **Private API Key** field is **not** required if you want to send the events via the Device Mode.
</div>

* **Site Type**: Choose the site type from the dropdown. If the site type is **Web App**, then RudderStack will start the ProfitWell service either with `email` or `userId`. For the type **Marketing**, RudderStack will start the ProfitWell service anonymously.
* **Use device-mode to send events**: Enable this option to send events via the web <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">device mode</Link>.

<div class="warningBlock">

</div>

* Finally, click on **Next** to complete the setup. ProfitWell should now be configured and enabled as a destination in RudderStack.

## Identify

For the **Web App** site type, the `identify` call will start the ProfitWell Service using the customer's `email`. If no email is provided, then RudderStack will start the service with the user's `userId`. For the **Marketing** type, RudderStack will start the ProfitWell service anonymously.

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
  rudderanalytics.identify( "userId", {email: "sample@domain.com"});
```

For the `identify` call to trigger user engagements, you need to first create [**Customers**](https://www2.profitwell.com/app/customers) within ProfitWell.
