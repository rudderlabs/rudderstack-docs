VWO is an A/B testing and product optimization platform that helps you improve your key business metrics through valuable insights and better product engagement. VWO provides an intuitive visual editor where you can run A/B tests without the need to write any HTML code.

RudderStack supports integration with VWO that allows you to send relevant events from VWO to other destinations configured to that source.

## Getting started

RudderStack supports sending event data to VWO via the following <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">connection modes</a>:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :--------- | :--------- |
| **Device mode**     | **Supported** | -          | -          |
| **Cloud mode**      | -             | -          | -          |

<div class="infoBlock">
In the web device mode integration, that is, using <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk">JavaScript SDK</Link> as a source, the VWO native SDK is loaded from <code class="inline-code">http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com</code> domain. Based on your website's content security policy, you might need to <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain">allowlist this domain</Link> to load the VWO SDK successfully.
</div>

<div class="warningBlock">
We support only JavaScript as a source while adding VWO as a destination in RudderStack.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the platform is supported, perform the steps below:

- From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderlabs.com/), add the JavaScript source and select VWO as a destination.
- After naming the destination, click on **Next**. You should see the following screen:

You can configure the settings such as enabling **Single Page Application**, setting **Library Tolerance** and **Settings Tolerance**, and **Use Existing jQuery** while initializing the VWO SDK. Send experiment viewed as track or identify traits can also be configured. To complete the configuration, click on **Next**.

## Sending Experiment Viewed from VWO

When one of the variations from an experiment is loaded for a user, RudderStack sends a <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track">`track`</Link> call with `Experiment Viewed` as the event name, along with the experiment and variation details as the associated properties.

A sample code snippet for this activity is as shown:

```
rudderanalytics.track('Experiment Viewed', {
  experiment_id: 'Signup',
  variation_name: 'Signup as a default landing'
});
```

This `track` event will be sent to the other destinations such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc. This is useful in analyzing the experiment results on a different platform. You can also set experiment-related data such as user traits, so that the other destinations have the knowledge of the variations a user has seen.

## Tracking Revenue Goals

RudderStack also allows forwarding the revenue amount to VWO when the <Link to="/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/ordering/#order-completed">`Order Completed`</Link> event is called.

A sample code snippet for the above `track` call is as shown:

```
// We use revenue or amount from the properties
rudderanalytics.track('Order Completed', {
  revenue: 125
});
```
