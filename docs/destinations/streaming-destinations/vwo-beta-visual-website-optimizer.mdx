VWO is an A/B testing and product optimization platform that helps you improve your key business metrics through valuable insights and better product engagement. VWO provides an intuitive visual editor where you can run A/B tests without the need to write any HTML code.

RudderStack supports integration with VWO that allows you to send relevant events from VWO to other destinations configured to that source.

## Getting started

Before configuring your source and destination on the RudderStack app, please check whether the platform you are working on is supported by VWO. Refer the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :--------- | :--------- |
| **Device mode**     | **Supported** | -          | -          |
| **Cloud mode**      | -             | -          | -          |

<div class="infoBlock">
To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</Link> guide.

<div class="warningBlock">
We support only JavaScript as a source while adding VWO as a destination in RudderStack.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the platform is supported, perform the steps below:

- From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderlabs.com/), add the JavaScript source and select VWO as a destination.
- After naming the destination, click on **Next**. You should see the following screen:

You can configure the settings such as enabling **Single Page Application**, setting **Library Tolerance** and **Settings Tolerance**, and **Use Existing jQuery** while initializing the VWO SDK. Send experiment viewed as track or identify traits can also be configured. To complete the configuration, click on **Next**.

## Sending Experiment Viewed from VWO

When one of the variations from an experiment is loaded for a user, RudderStack sends a <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track">`track`</Link> call with `Experiment Viewed` as the event name, along with the experiment and variation details as the associated properties.

A sample code snippet for this activity is as shown:

```
rudderanalytics.track('Experiment Viewed', {
  experiment_id: 'Signup',
  variation_name: 'Signup as a default landing'
});
```

This `track` event will be sent to the other destinations such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc. This is useful in analyzing the experiment results on a different platform. You can also set experiment-related data such as user traits, so that the other destinations have the knowledge of the variations a user has seen.

## Tracking Revenue Goals

RudderStack also allows forwarding the revenue amount to VWO when the <Link to="/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/ordering/#order-completed">`Order Completed`</Link> event is called.

A sample code snippet for the above `track` call is as shown:

```
// We use revenue or amount from the properties
rudderanalytics.track('Order Completed', {
  revenue: 125
});
```
