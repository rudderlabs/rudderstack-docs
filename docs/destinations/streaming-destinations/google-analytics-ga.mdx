Google Analytics is the world's most popular analytics service that lets you track and report your website traffic across a variety of sources.

RudderStack supports Google Analytics as a destination and makes requests to its endpoints through the [Google Analytics Measurement Protocol](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1).

<div class="infoBlock">
Find the open source transformer code for this destination in the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/v0/destinations/ga">GitHub repository</a>.
</div>

## Getting started

Before configuring Google Analytics as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Google Analytics by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device Mode**     | **Supported** | -             | -             |
| **Cloud Mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">
To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</Link> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Google Analytics, follow these steps:

1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Google Analytics**.
2. Assign a name to the destination and click on **Next**.

### Connection Settings

To successfully configure **Google Analytics** as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings where **Tracking ID** is the only required field.

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on getting your Google Analytics tracking ID, refer to the <Link to="#faq">FAQ</Link> section below.
</div>

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/ga-connection-settings-2.png" alt="Google Analytics dashboard settings" />
<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/ga-connection-settings-3.png" alt="Google Analytics dashboard settings" />
<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/ga-connection-settings-4.png" alt="Google Analytics dashboard settings" />
<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/ga-connection-settings-5.png" alt="Google Analytics dashboard settings" />

Once the destination is set up, events from RudderStack will automatically start flowing to Google Analytics. You can see the events in Google Analytics' real-time view.

## Page

RudderStack sends a `pageview` hit to Google Analytics whenever you make a `page()` call using the SDK.

From our JavaScript libraries, we automatically collect the following page properties with the **`page()`** call just after the **`load()`** call:

- `path`
- `url`
- `title`
- `search`
- `referrer`

> For a page loaded at `http://localhost/test_browser.html?param1=true` with title "Page Load"

| Property   | Value                                                                                            |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `path`     | /test_browser.html                                                                               |
| `referrer` | ""                                                                                               |
| `search`   | ?param1=true                                                                                     |
| `title`    | Page Load                                                                                        |
| `url`      | `http://localhost/test_browser.html?param1=true`                                                 |

You can also override these values and call `page()` with properties as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page({
  path: "path",
  url: "url",
  title: "title",
  search: "search",
  referrer: "referrer"
});
```

<div class="warningBlock">
It is important to send a <code class="inline-code">path</code> or <code class="inline-code">url</code> property with page call, otherwise Google Analytics will reject the event.
</div>

There are other variants of the `page()` call that you can send, which involve giving your page's `name` and `category` :

```javascript
// Passing page category and name
rudderanalytics.page("category", "name", {
  path: "path",
  url: "url",
  title: "title",
  search: "search",
  referrer: "referrer",
})

// "home" is the name of the page.
rudderanalytics.page("home", {
  path: "path",
  url: "url",
  title: "title",
  search: "search",
  referrer: "referrer",
})
```

<div class="infoBlock">
For a server-side page call, the application name is passed from RudderStack's <code class="inline-code">context.app.name</code> as <code class="inline-code">an</code>, otherwise the event will be rejected by GA.
If the <strong>Include the Querystring in Page Views</strong> option is enabled in the RudderStack destination settings, then the entire URL with the querystring will be sent as <code class="inline-code">dp</code> (Document Path). Otherwise, the querystring will be removed from the URL.
</div>

## Identify

Personally Identifiable Information \(PII\) cannot be sent to the Google Analytics reporting interface. Thus nothing is passed to Google unless specifically directed.

Google Analytics' universal tracking allows you to set a user ID to the identified visitors if **Send User ID** **to GA** is enabled in the destination settings by the user. Also, the `userid` property must be enabled in Google Analytics, and user-id view needs to be created.

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("user123", {
  name: "Alex Keener",
  email: "alex@example.com"
});
```

In the above snippet, the `userid` will be set to `user123` for Google Analytics, but the name and email will not be shared with Google. Traits along with custom dimensions, metrics, and content groupings can be set in the SDK.

For server-side, Google Analytics needs a customer identifier for each call to be made. RudderStack passes an internally generated ID as the `cid` parameter for Google Analytics to understand every unique user. Traits are not mapped to custom dimensions, metrics and content grouping yet from our side in server-side.

You can call `identify` once in order to set the `userId` and `user traits`for all subsequent calls that you make from our SDK for a particular user. If `userId` is not set, RudderStack sends a generated ID \(called `anonymousId`\) from its SDKs with every call made to the RudderStack servers. This `id` is used as the `cid` in Google Analytics. And if Send User ID to GA setting is enabled, the user ID property will be set as `uid` and will be sent as well.

## Custom Dimensions

In Google Analytics, you can configure custom dimensions in the [Admin](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6132368?hl=en) page.

There are multiple scopes for custom dimensions, such as `hits`, `session`, `user`, and `products` \(If Enhanced eCommerce is enabled\). Once these are set up in Google Analytics, the traits and properties can be mapped to custom dimensions as set by the user in the RudderStack destination settings page \(as seen in the Getting Started section\).

A custom dimension should be set as `dimension{index}` . For example, `dimension1` and it will map accordingly when the user sets the dimension in GA settings as shown below.

Similar activity is to be done for metrics.

<img src="../../assets/image (59).png" />

<img src="../../assets/image (36).png" />

An `identify` call with custom dimensions will be recorded after the next `track` or `page` call.

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify({
  Gender: 'Female'
});

rudderanalytics.track('Viewed History');
```

## Track

RudderStack captures any user activity whenever a `track()` call is made.

A simple `track` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Track me")
```

This will send the following `Event Category` and `Event Action` :

| Property       | Value      |
| :------------- | :--------- |
| Event Category | All        |
| Event Action   | `Track me` |

<div class="infoBlock">
We do not populate the <code class="inline-code">Event Category</code> field by default. If you face such a requirement, use our custom transformations to populate the event payload with a <code class="inline-code">category</code> property.
</div>

A more verbose `track` call is shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Track me", {
  category: "category",
  label: "label",
  value: "value"
});
```

The following properties are sent to the Google Analytics event:

| Property       | Value      |
| :------------- | :--------- |
| Event Category | `category` |
| Event Action   | `Track me` |
| Event Label    | `label`    |
| Event Value    | `value`    |

## Non-Interaction Events

If the non-interaction setting is enabled in the RudderStack destination settings, `nonInteraction` with value `1` will be sent.

```javascript
{
  "action": "track",
  "event": "Track Page",
  "properties": {
    "nonInteraction": 1
  }
}
```

In Google Analytics, some events can be tagged as non-interaction events. On the server-side, it is set in `ni` .

## E-Commerce

RudderStack supports basic E-Commerce tracking for Google Analytics.

The required steps are:

- For every order completed, `orderId` is required. For each product in the order, there must be an `id` and `name`. Other properties are optional.
- The E-Commerce tracking should be enabled otherwise it will not be shown in the reports.

## Enhanced E-Commerce

Enhanced E-Commerce allows you to derive insights on the E-Commerce events by combining impression data, product data, promotion data and action data. This is a necessity for product-scoped custom dimensions.

Enhanced E-Commerce must be enabled in Google Analytics, and should follow RudderStack's <Link to="/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/">E-commerce Events Specification</Link>.

The required steps are:

- Similar to E-Commerce tracking, for every order completed the `orderId` is required. For each product, `id` and `name`are required.
- The product ID or name must be passed for all the events that has the product details. `product_id` will check if `properties.product_id` is present or not. Else `properties.sku` will be picked.
- `order_id` is required for refunded orders.

To send Enhanced E-Commerce events, please enable it in the RudderStack destination settings page.

### Measuring Checkout Steps

The Checkout steps feature is a key difference between the regular E-Commerce and Enhanced E-Commerce tracking, and a major feature of the latter.

You can configure the checkout funnel in the Google Analytics admin interface as shown below:

<img src="../../assets/image (21).png" />

The checkout flow can be implemented by calling `track` with `checkout step viewed` and `checkout step completed` for the steps you have added in Google Analytics.

An example of this is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track('checkout step viewed', {
            currency: 'CAD',
            step: 1
          });
rudderanalytics.track('checkout step completed', {
            currency: 'CAD',
            step: 1,
            //if this is the shipping step
            shippingMethod: 'FedEx',
            //if this is the payment step
            paymentMethod: 'Visa'
          });
```

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information, refer to the <Link to="/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/">E-commerce Events Specification</Link> guide.
</div>

### Measuring Promotions

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track('promotion viewed', {
            currency: 'CAD',
            promotion_id: 'PROMO_1234',
            name: 'Winter Sale',
            creative: 'winter_banner2',
            position: 'banner_slot1',
            testDimension: true,
            testMetric: true
          });
rudderanalytics.track('promotion clicked', {
            currency: 'CAD',
            promotion_id: 'PROMO_1234',
            name: 'winter Sale',
            creative: 'winter_banner2',
            position: 'banner_slot1',
            testDimension: true,
            testMetric: true
          });
```

### Coupons

You can add the `coupon` property if you want to send coupon data to **`order completed`**.

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track('order completed', {
            orderId: 'abc55',
            total: 999.9,
            shipping: 23.99,
            tax: 25.99,
            currency: 'CAD',
            coupon: 'coupon',
            affiliation: 'affiliation',
            testDimension: true,
            testMetric: true,
            products: [
              {
                quantity: 1,
                price: 24.75,
                name: 'rudder product',
                category: 'cat 1',
                sku: 'p-298',
                productDimension: 'testing'
              },
              {
                quantity: 3,
                price: 24.75,
                name: 'other product',
                category: 'cat 2',
                sku: 'p-299',
                currency: 'EUR',
                productDimension: 'testing'
              }
            ]
          });
```

### Measuring Product Impressions

Information related to impressions of the users who have viewed or filtered through the product can be collected through Enhanced E-Commerce. The product impressions are mapped to **`product list viewed`** and **`product list filtered`** events.

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track('product list filtered', {
            category: 'cat 1',
            list_id: '1234',
            filters: [
              {
                type: 'department',
                value: 'beauty'
              },
              {
                type: 'price',
                value: 'under'
              }
            ],
            sorts: [
              {
                type: 'price',
                value: 'desc'
              }
            ],
            products: [
              {
                product_id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439011',
                productDimension: 'My Product Dimension',
                productMetric: 'My Product Metric'
              }
            ],
            testDimension: true,
            testMetric: true
          });
rudderanalytics.track('Product List Viewed', {
            category: 'cat 1',
            list_id: '1234',
            products: [
              {
                product_id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439011',
                productDimension: 'My Product Dimension1',
                productMetric: 'My Product Metric1',
                position: 10
              },
              {
                product_id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439012',
                productDimension: 'My Product Dimension2',
                productMetric: 'My Product Metric2',
                position: 12
              },
              {
                product_id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439015',
                productDimension: 'My Product Dimension3',
                productMetric: 'My Product Metric3',
                position: 8
              }
            ]
          });
```

### Refunds

For full refunds :

```javascript
 rudderanalytics.track('order refunded', {
            order_id: 'abc55',
            testDimension: true,
            testMetric: true
          });
```

For partial refunds:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track('order refunded', {
            order_id: 'abc55',
            products: [
              {
                quantity: 1,
                sku: 'p-1'
              },
              {
                quantity: 2,
                sku: 'p-2'
              }
            ],
            testDimension: true,
            testMetric: true
          });
```

## Passing Cookies from Universal Analytics

`clientId` \(cid\) is used to keep a track of the unique visitors to your website.

A Google Analytics universal cookie will look like the following:

```
_ga=GA1.2.476220681.159039102;
```

The `clientId` is `476220681.159039102` which can be cross-checked by running the following snippet:

```
ga(function (tracker) {
    var clientId = tracker.get('clientId');
    console.log('My GA universal client ID is: ' + clientId);
});
```

For server-side calls, if `clientId` is passed manually by sending `anonymousId` and if the **Send User ID** setting is enabled in the destination settings along with `cid`, then RudderStack passes the `userId` as the `uid`.

### How RudderStack takes the `clientId`

RudderStack takes the `clientId` in the following **decreasing** order of priority:

1. From the `integrations` object while initializing the SDK, as shown:

```javascript
"integrations": {
  "All": true,
  "Google Analytics": {
    "clientId": "clientId"
  }
},
```

2. From the `gaExternalId` by setting it as the `clientId`, if specified in the payload.
3. From `anonymousId`, if present.

<div class="infoBlock">
If the <strong>Disable MD5 encryption from Client ID</strong> setting is disabled in the dashboard, RudderStack passes the <code class="inline-code">userId</code> as the <code class="inline-code">clientId</code> in the MD5-hashed format.
<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/ga-md5-encryption-disabled.png" alt="MD5 disabled" />
</div>

## User Agent

On the server-side, `user_agent` is set from `context.userAgent`.

## Visitor Geo Location

On the client-side tracking, the IP address of the HTTP request is sent automatically to determine the location of the visitor. However, on the server-side, the visitor's IP has to be included in the `track` call.

## UTM Parameters

The UTM parameters need to be passed manually to the server.

UTM parameters are passed in the context object in `context.campaign`. `campaign.name` and `campaign.mediums` must be sent together to show up in the report. Also, `campaign.term` and `campaign.content` are optional.

## Measurement protocol parameters

You can also send data to Google Analytics using the measurement protocol. It provides parameters which are automatically collected by the device mode Google Universal Analytics tracker. You can collect the value of the parameter as a RudderStack trait or property when sending server-side events to Universal Analytics.

RudderStack supports the following measurement protocol parameters:

| Parameters       | Mapping value    |
| :------------- | :--------- |
| [`sr`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#sr) | `context.screen.width x context.screen.height` |
| [`vp`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#vp)   | `context.screen.innerWidth x context.screen.innerHeight` |
| [`ci`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#ci)   | `context.campaign.campaignId`    |
| [`gclid`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#gclid)   | from externalID  `googleAdsId`   |
| [`dclid`](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/parameters#dclid)    | from externalID `googleDisplayAdsId` |

The sample code below shows how to send `gclid` and `dclid` using `externalID`:

```javascript
"externalId": [{
    "type": "googleAdsId",
    "id": "gclid_value"
  },
  {
    "type": "googleDisplayAdsId",
    "id": "dclid_value"
  }
]
```

## Additional Features

There are some other important features associated with Google Analytics integration, as described in the sections below:

### Named Tracker

If you turn on the named tracker in RudderStack destination setting under the **Other Settings** option, Rudder will push the events to a GA tracker named as `rudderGATracker` instead of the default tracker.

For more information on creating trackers follow [this guide](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/creating-trackers).

If it is turned off default tracker which is internally given the name `t0` will be set.

#### Multiple Trackers

A 2nd tracker can be set in the ready callback function of RudderStack SDK.

An example of sending events to GA with another tracking id:

```javascript
// without any tracker name
window.rudderanalytics.ready(() => {
  console.log("we are all set!!!")
  window.ga("create", "UA-XXXXXXX-1", "auto")
  window.ga("send", "pageview")
})

// with a tracker name
window.rudderanalytics.ready(() => {
  console.log("we are all set!!!")
  window.ga("create", "UA-XXXXXXX-1", "auto", { name: "newTracker" })
  window.ga("newTracker.send", "pageview")
})
```

### Anonymize IP Address

You can turn on **Anonymize IP Address** in the RudderStack destination settings under the **Other Settings** option. Once this setting is enabled, Google Analytics anonymizes the address at the earliest possible stage of the collection network.

### Cookie Domain Name

The default value of this is set to `auto` . However, you can change it in the destination settings. You can get more information on this feature by referring to [Google documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/domains).

### Cross-domain Tracking

There are two ways to do this:

- Tracking visitors with `userid`: If the **Send User ID** destination setting is enabled, it will be sent to identify the user, However, this only works for the identified users. Anonymous visitor sessions will not be maintained.
- Tracking Anonymous Visitors: `allowLinker` is enabled automatically by RudderStack as Google Analytics provides an auto-linking plugin that allows you to track cookies and anonymous visitors when moving from one page to the other.

### Ignored Referrers

For Universal profiles, this can be edited in Google Analytics directly.

### Remarketing

This feature is used to tag visitors for remarketing campaign. Enable the **Remarketing, Display Ads and Demographic Reports** option in the **Reporting** section of the destination settings to utilize this feature.

### Site Search

When someone searches the site, the search term has to be added to the URL query. This feature comes in handy in such a case.

To enable this feature, turn on **Include the Querystring in page views** option in the destination settings

In your Google Analytics account, enable **Site search Tracking** and put the parameter query.

If the query is `abc.com/s=xyz`the setting should be as follows:

<img src="../../assets/image (18) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" />

### Optimize Container ID

Add your **Optimize Container ID** in the destination settings.

<div class="infoBlock">
If the container ID is specified in the destination settings and Optimize is linked to your Google Analytics property, then it will be automatically enabled the next time <code class="inline-code">analytics.js</code> is loaded. <strong>Note that this is applicable only if you are using the integration in the web device mode</strong>.
</div>

### What are custom metrics and custom dimensions?

**Custom metrics** and **custom dimensions** are fields that allow you to track custom properties associated with your events using RudderStack.

Metrics is for event properties having numeric data type while dimensions is for event properties having string data type. Both are used to track custom data properties in Google Analytics.

Please refer to the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section above in this document to know how to specify these fields on the RudderStack platform.

### My website uses HTTPS. Do I need to change any settings for accurate Google Analytics tracking?

Yes. In the **Property Setup**, please change the website URL from HTTP \(default\) to HTTPS as shown:

### Why are my page views in Google Analytics different when sent from device mode as against the cloud mode?

There could be 2 reasons for this:

- There can be ad blockers enabled in the user's browser while visiting your site. This blocks the Google Analytics requests from being sent directly from the browser.
- For the cloud mode, RudderStack is not blocked by ad blockers presently. If the events are sent to Google Analytics via the cloud mode, the actual number of events intended to be sent to Google Analytics are forwarded by the RudderStack server. So, the number of requests from the native mode or device mode is expected to be lower than cloud mode.

The RudderStack JavaScript SDK provides a way of detecting how many page view requests are potentially being blocked by the ad blockers throughout your site pages. Please check the section on <Link to="/sources/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/#detecting-ad-blocked-pages">Detecting Ad-blocked Pages</Link> for more information.
