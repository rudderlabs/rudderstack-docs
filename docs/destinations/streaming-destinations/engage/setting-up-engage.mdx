2. Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.

## Connection settings

To successfully set up Engage as a destination, you need to configure the following settings:

- **Public Key**: Enter your Engage public key by logging into to your Engage dashboard and going to **Settings** > **Account** > **Your API Key**.

- **List IDs**: Enter your Engage list ID. You can get it by logging into your Engage dashboard and going to **Lists** > clicking your list > **Subscription and Settings** > **Your list ID**.
- **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Engage. For more information on this setting, refer to the <Link to="/sources/sdks/event-filtering/">Client-side Events Filtering</Link> guide.
