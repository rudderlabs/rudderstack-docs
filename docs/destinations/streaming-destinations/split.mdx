RudderStack sends each call as an event to Split.

## Identify

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify">`identify`</Link> call lets you uniquely identify a user and record any associated traits about them like their name, email, etc.

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm", {
  name: "Alex Keener",
  email: "alex@example.com",
  plan: "GOLD",
  age: 40,
})
```

## Track

A <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track">`track`</Link> call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Clicked button", {
  color: "red",
  buttonText: "Get started",
})
```

RudderStack sends the above `track` call as a `Clicked_button` event to Split along with the additional properties.

The `eventTypeId` argument (**Clicked button** in the above example) in `track` call should meet the following requirements:
- It should start with a letter or number.
- It should contain 80 characters or less.
- It should contain only letters, numbers, hyphen, underscore, or period.

## Page

A <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/page">`page`</Link> call lets you record your website's page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.

A sample `page` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page("homepage", "home", {
  url: "https://abc.com",
  title: "Test",
  referrer: "https://google.com",
})
```

RudderStack sends the above `page` call as a `Viewed_home_page` event to Split, along with the associated properties.

## Screen

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/screen">`screen`</Link> call lets you record whenever the user views their mobile screen, with any additional relevant information about the screen.

A sample `screen` call is shown below:

```javascript
[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@"Main" properties:@{@"prop_key" : @"prop_value"}];
```

The above snippet captures information related to the viewed screen such as its name and category. RudderStack sends this call as a `Viewed_Main_screen` event, along with the associated properties.

## Group

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/group">`group`</Link> call lets you link an identified user with a group such as a company, organization, or an account, and record any traits associated with that group, for example, company name, number of employees, etc.

A sample `group` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.group("groupId", traits, options, callback)
```
