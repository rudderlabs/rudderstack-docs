[Qualaroo](https://qualaroo.com/) is a customer survey and user feedback platform. It lets you survey your users to understand how they are using your product and what they think of it.

## Getting started

RudderStack supports sending events to Qualaroo via the following <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">connection modes</Link>:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     |        **Supported**       |               |               |
| **Cloud mode**      |        -       |  -   |   -            |

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Qualaroo, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Qualaroo**.
2. Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.

## Connection settings

To successfully configure Qualaroo as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

- **Customer ID**: Enter your Qualaroo customer ID which is a part of your Qualaroo JavaScript library URL. For example, if your URL is `https://cl.qualaroo.com/ki.js/92102/j8N.js`, then the customer ID would be `92102`.
- **Site Token**: Enter your Qualaroo site token which is a part of your Qualaroo JavaScript library URL. For example, if your URL is `https://cl.qualaroo.com/ki.js/92102/j8N.js`, then the site token would be `j8N`.

</div>

- **Record Qualaroo Events**: Enable this setting to allow RudderStack to automatically record your Qualaroo callback events as `track` events. You can then view and analyze these events using other tools (connected to the same source in RudderStack). 
  - **List of Events**: Select the list of events from dropdown which RudderStack automatically records as `track` events.
- **Update Event Name in track call**: Enable this setting to update the event name in the `track` call.
  - **Mapping to update the Event Name in track call**: Use this setting to map your events with the standard Qualaroo callback events.
- **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Qualaroo. For more information on this setting, refer to the <Link to="/sources/sdks/event-filtering/">Client-side Events Filtering</Link> guide.
- **Use device mode to send events**: As this is a <Link to="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">web device mode</Link>-only destination, this setting is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.
- **OneTrust Cookie Categories**: This setting lets you associate the <Link to="/sources/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/consent-managers/onetrust/">OneTrust</Link> cookie consent groups to Qualaroo.

## Identify

You can use the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify/">`identify`</Link> call to send user-related information to Qualaroo.

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("alex@example.com", {
  name: "Alex Keener",
  age: 25
})
```

RudderStack uses Qualaroo's [Identity API](https://help.qualaroo.com/hc/en-us/articles/201956628-Using-the-Identity-API-call) method to send the user information.

<div class="infoBlock">
If an empty string is passed as an identifier, Qualaroo considers the user to be an unknown visitor or a user with no account.
</div>

### Supported mapping

The following table lists the mappings between the RudderStack and Qualaroo properties:

| RudderStack property | Qualaroo property  |
|:---------------------|:-------------|
| `userId` <br/> `context.traits.email` <br/> `context.traits.userId` <br /> `context.traits.id` | `identify` | 
| `context.traits` | `traits` |

## Track

You can use the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track/">`track`</Link> call to track user activities and send this information to Qualaroo.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Product Viewed")
```

You can also map your `track` events to the standard Qualaroo callback events using the **Mapping to update the Event Name in track call** dashboard setting, as shown:

### Recording Qualaroo callback events

| Event name | Description |

| `close` | When a visitor submits the survey. |
| `submit` | When a visitor replies to a question. |
| `noTargetMatch` | When no surveys are set to fire. |

## Page

You can use the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/page/">`page`</Link> call to send any page-related information to Qualaroo.

A sample `page` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page("Home")
```

| RudderStack property | Qualaroo property | Notes |
