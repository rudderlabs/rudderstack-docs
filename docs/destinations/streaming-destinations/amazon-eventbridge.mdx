  Step-by-step guide on sending your event data from RudderStack to Amazon EventBridge.
---

[Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) is a serverless event bus that allows you to connect applications using data from your own apps, integrated SaaS applications, or AWS services.

RudderStack supports Amazon EventBridge as a destination where you can seamlessly send your event data.

Find the open source code for this destination in the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/eventbridge">GitHub repository</a>.
</div>

## Getting started

RudderStack supports sending event data to EventBridge via the following <Link to="/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">connection modes</Link>:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | -             | -             | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to EventBridge, follow these steps:

1. From your RudderStack dashboard, add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **AWS EventBridge**.
2. Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.

### Connection settings

To successfully set up EventBridge as a destination, you need to configure the following settings:

- **AWS Region**: Enter the AWS region in which you have created the EventBridge bus. This is a required field.
- **Role-based Authentication**: Enable this setting to use the RudderStack IAM role for authentication. For more information on creating an AWS IAM role for RudderStack, refer to <Link to="/destinations/aws-iam-role-for-rudderstack/#creating-a-rudderstack-iam-role">this guide</Link>.
  - **IAM Role ARN**: Enter the ARN of the IAM role.

<div class="warningBlock">
It is highly recommended to enable this setting as the access keys-based authentication method is now deprecated.
</div>

- If **Role-based Authentication** is disabled, you need to enter the **AWS Access Key ID** and **AWS Secret Access Key** to authorize RudderStack in order to write to the configured event bus. 

<div class="infoBlock">
In both the role-based and access key-based authentication methods, you need to set a policy specifying the required permissions for RudderStack to write to your event bus. Refer to the <Link to="#policy-permissions">Policy permissions</Link> section below for more information. 
</div>

- **Event Bus Name**: Specify the name of the event bus where you want to send the events. RudderStack sends the event to the default bus if no event bus name is specified.
- **Detail Type**: Specify the event's detail type to send to EventBridge. This is a **required** field.
- **Amazon Resource Name:** This field contains an ARN (Amazon Resource Name) that identifies a resource involved in your EventBridge setup. To add multiple ARNs (for multiple targets involved in your setup), click **+ ADD MORE**.

## Policy permissions

To authorize RudderStack, you need to create an IAM policy that provides the required permission to write to your event bus. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/iam-identity-based-access-control-eventbridge.html">Using Identity-Based Policies (IAM Policies) for EventBridge</a> guide to know the applicable policies.

A sample permissions policy that allows a user to put event data into EventBridge is shown below:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "CloudWatchEventsInvocationAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["events:PutEvents"],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Sending events to EventBridge

You can map a RudderStack event to an EventBridge event in the following manner:

| RudderStack          | EventBridge        |
| :------------------- | :----------------- |
| Event payload        | `Detail`       |
| Amazon Resource Name |`Resources`   |
| Detail Type          | `DetailType`   |
| Event Bus Name       | `EventBusName` |
| `"rudderstack"`      | `Source`      |

- **Event Payload**: This is the generated event payload
- **Amazon Resource Name, Detail Type, Event Bus Name**: These are the values you configured while setting up the destination with RudderStack.
