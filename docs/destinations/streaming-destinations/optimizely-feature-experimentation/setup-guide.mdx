RudderStack supports sending event data to Optimizely Feature Experimentation via the following <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">connection modes</a>:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**      | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :----- | :----- |
| **Device Mode**     | **-** | **Supported**  | **-**  |
| **Cloud Mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported**  | **Supported**  |

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Optimizely Feature Experimentation, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Optimizely Fullstack**.
2. Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.

## Connection settings

To successfully configure Optimizely Feature Experimentation as a destination, configure the following settings:

- **SDK Key**: Enter your Optimizely SDK key. You can find it by going to your [Optimizely dashboard](https://app.optimizely.com/) and navigating to **Settings** > **Environments** > **SDK Key / Primary URL**.
- **Base URL**: Enter the URL where your [Optimizely Agent](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/v4.0/docs/optimizely-agent) is running. For more information on setting up the Optimizely Agent, refer to the [Optimizely documentation](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/v4.0/docs/setup-optimizely-agent).
- **Track Known Users**: By default, this setting is enabled. RudderStack tracks only the known users and maps `userId` to Optimizely's `userId`. When disabled, RudderStack maps `anonymousId` to Optimizely's `userId`.

- **Send the experiment and variation information as properties in track calls**: This setting is enabled by default and is applicable for the device mode. RudderStack sends the experiment-related data to the other destinations as `track` calls. RudderStack does this by triggering the `Experiment Viewed` event every time an Optimizely live variable is accessed.
- **Specify Experiment Viewed as non-interaction event for Google Analytics**: This setting is enabled by default and is applicable for the device mode. RudderStack sends a `Experiment Viewed` call as a non-interaction event.
- **Track Categorized Pages**: This setting is applicable **only** for the cloud mode. When enabled, RudderStack sends every `page` call you make along with the page `category` as a `track` event.
- **Track Named Pages**: This setting is applicable **only** for the cloud mode. When enabled, RudderStack sends every `page` call you make along with the page `name` as a `track` event.
- **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting is applicable only if you're sending events via the **device mode**. It lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Optimizely.  Refer to the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/">Client-side Event Filtering</Link> guide for more information on this feature.
