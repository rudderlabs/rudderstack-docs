RudderStack lets you send your web experimentation data to Optimizely Feature Experimentation via the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode">cloud mode</Link>.

Find the open source transformer code for this destination in the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/">GitHub repository</a>.

## Track

RudderStack uses the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track">`track`</Link> call to send the experiment-related information to Optimizely. To do so, it uses Optimizely's <a href="https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/experimentation/v3.1.0-full-stack/reference/trackevent">`track`</a> API.

<div class="infoBlock">
You can view the metrics for an experiment either on the <strong>Results</strong> page of your Optimizely dashboard or as a data export. For more information, refer to the <Link to="#viewing-experimentation-results">Viewing experimentation results</Link> section below.
</div>

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(
  "Product Added", {
    item: "Tshirt",
    currency: "USD"
  })
```

### Supported mappings

The following table lists the RudderStack event properties and their mappings with the Optimizely fields:

| RudderStack property   | Optimizely property |  Data type |
| :-------------| :-----------------| :---- |
| `event` <br/> <span style="color: #4D4DFF;font-size:12px;">Required</span> | `eventKey` | String |
| `userId` / `anonymousId` <br/> <span style="color: #4D4DFF;font-size:12px;">Required</span> | `userId` | String |
| `traits` / `context.traits` | `userAttributes` | Object |
| `properties` | `eventTags` | Object |

### Viewing experimentation results

To view the experimentation-related metrics in the **Results** page of your Optimizely dashboard, make sure you:

- Use the <a href="https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/experimentation/v3.1.0-full-stack/reference/activate">`activate`</a> API first and then send your `track` events. If you do not activate the user, RudderStack will not send any decision event to Optimizely and the event won't be attributed to the user.
- Pass the same `userId` in your events that you pass to the `activate` API.

## Page

RudderStack's <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/page">`page`</Link> call lets you record your website's page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.

If you have enabled the **Track Categorized Pages** or **Track Named Pages** dashboard setting, then RudderStack sends a `page` call with the page `category` or `name` as a `track` event to Optimizely with the event name as `Viewed ${category} page` or `Viewed ${name} page`.

A sample `page` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page("home");
```

In the above snippet, `home` is the name of the web page. If **Track Named Pages** setting is enabled, RudderStack sends a `track` event named `Viewed home page` to Optimizely.

## Screen

RudderStack's <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/screen">`screen`</Link> call lets you record your users' mobile screen views with any additional relevant information about the screen.

RudderStack sends every `screen` call to Optimizely as a `track` event with the name `Viewed ${name} screen`, where `name` is the name of the viewed screen. If you do not provide any name, RudderStack sets the event name as `Viewed screen`.

A sample `screen` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.screen("Main");
```

In the above snippet, `Main` is the name of the app screen. RudderStack then sends a `track` event named `Viewed Main screen` to Optimizely.

## FAQ

### I am unable to see the events in my experiments. What should I do?

Define the custom events in your Optimizely Web dashboard and add those events as metrics in the corresponding Optimizely experiment.

While defining the custom event, make sure you also provide the **API Name** and while calling the <Link to="#track">`track`</Link> API, use this name as the name of your event.

For more information on creating custom events in Optimizely Web, refer to this <a href="https://support.optimizely.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410288960909-Custom-events-in-Optimizely-Web#heading-3">Optimizely support article</a>.
