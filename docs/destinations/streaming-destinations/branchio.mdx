description: Step-by-step guide on sending your event data from RudderStack to Branch.io
---

[Branch.io](https://branch.io) is an industry leader in cross-platform attribution, mobile app measurement, and deep linking. Many top-ranking apps use Branch to increase their performance and revenue through better performance and engagement.

RudderStack supports Branch as a destination where you can seamlessly send your customer data.

<div class="infoBlock">
Find the open source transformer code for this destination in the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/src/v0/destinations/branch">GitHub repository</a>.
</div>

## Getting started

Before configuring Branch as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Branch by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile**    | **Server** |
| :------------------ | :------ | :------------ | :--------- |
| **Device mode**     | -       | **Supported** | -          |
| **Cloud mode**      | -       | **Supported** | -          |

<div class="infoBlock">
To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</Link> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Branch, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Branch Metrics**.
2. Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.

## Connection settings

To successfully configure Branch as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings: 

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/branchio-connection-settings.png" alt="Branch connection settings"/>

- **Branch key**: Enter your Branch key from the **Settings** section in the [Branch dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings).
- **Client-side Events Filtering**: This setting lets you specify which events should be blocked or allowed to flow through to Branch.

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on this setting, refer to the <Link to="/sources/sdks/event-filtering/">Client-side Events Filtering</Link> guide.
</div>

## Adding device mode integration

Depending on your platform of integration, follow the below steps below to integrate Branch with your app.

<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>iOS</Tab>
    <Tab>iOS v2</Tab>
    <Tab>Android</Tab>
  </TabList>
    <TabPanels>
      <TabPanel>
<ol>
<li>Open the <code class="inline-code">Podfile</code> of your project and add the following line
<span>

```ruby
pod 'Rudder-Branch', '0.1.3'
```
</span>

followed by
<span>

```bash
$ pod install
```
</span>
</li>
<li>Finally change the SDK initialization with the following
<span>

```objectivec
RudderConfigBuilder *builder = [[RudderConfigBuilder alloc] init];
[builder withDataPlaneUrl:<DATA_PLANE_URL>];
[builder withFactory:[RudderBranchFactory instance]];
[builder withLoglevel:RudderLogLevelDebug];
[RudderClient getInstance:<WRITE_KEY> config:[builder build]];
```
</span>
</li>
</ol>

<TabPanel>
        <div class="warningBlock">
          This device mode integration is supported for Branch v1.41.0 and above.
        </div>
        Follow these steps to add Branch to your iOS project:
<ol>
<li>Install <code class="inline-code">RudderBranch</code> (available through <a href="https://cocoapods.org/">CocoaPods</a>) by adding the following line to your <code class="inline-code">Podfile</code>:
<span>

```ruby
pod 'RudderBranch', '~> 1.0.0'
```
</span>
</li>
<li>Run the <code class="inline-code">pod install</code> command.</li>
<li>Then, import the SDK depending on your preferred platform:
<span>

```swift
import RudderBranch
```
</span>
<span>

```objectivec
@import RudderBranch;
```
</span>
</li>
<li>Next, add the imports to your <code class="inline-code">AppDelegate</code> file under the <code class="inline-code">didFinishLaunchingWithOptions</code> method, as shown:
<br /><br />
<span>

```swift
let config: RSConfig = RSConfig(writeKey: WRITE_KEY)
            .dataPlaneURL(DATA_PLANE_URL)

RSClient.sharedInstance().configure(with: config)
RSClient.sharedInstance().addDestination(RudderBranchDestination())
```
</span>
<span>

```objectivec
RSConfig *config = [[RSConfig alloc] initWithWriteKey:WRITE_KEY];
[config dataPlaneURL:DATA_PLANE_URL];

[[RSClient sharedInstance] configureWith:config];
[[RSClient sharedInstance] addDestination:[[RudderBranchDestination alloc] init]];
```
</span>
</li>
</ol>
    </TabPanel>
<TabPanel>
 Your Android project must be on <strong>version 5.0 (API level 21) or higher</strong> for RudderStack to be able to send events to Branch.

Once confirmed, follow these steps to add Branch to your Android project:
<ol>
<li>Open your <code class="inline-code">app/build.gradle</code> (Module: app) file, add the following
<span>

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```
</span>
</li>
<li>Add the following under <code class="inline-code">dependencies</code> section
<span>

```groovy
implementation 'com.rudderstack.android.sdk:core:1.0.1'
implementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:branch:0.1.3'

// branch SDK requirements
implementation 'io.branch.sdk.android:library:4.3.2'
implementation'com.android.installreferrer:installreferrer:1.1.2'
implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-appindexing:19.1.0'
implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-ads:16+'
```
</span>
</li>
<li>Finally change the initialization of the SDK with the following
<span>

```kotlin
val rudderClient: RudderClient = RudderClient.getInstance(
    this,
    <WRITE_KEY>,
    RudderConfig.Builder()
        .withDataPlaneUrl(<DATA_PLANE_URL>)
        .withLogLevel(RudderLogger.RudderLogLevel.DEBUG)
        .withFactory(BranchIntegrationFactory.FACTORY)
        .build()
)
```
</span>
</li>
</ol>
      </TabPanel>
    </TabPanels>
</Tabs>

## Identify

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify">`identify`</Link> call associates a user to their actions and also captures the traits associated with that user.

A sample `identify` call captured from the RudderStack iOS SDK is as shown:

```objectivec
[[RudderClient sharedInstance] identify:@"developer_user_id"
                                 traits:@{@"foo": @"bar", @"foo1": @"bar1"}];
```

<div class="infoBlock">
You can call <code class="inline-code">identify</code> when the user registers to the app for the first time, logs into the app, or updates their information.
</div>

## Track

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track">`track`</Link> call lets you record the customer events along with any properties associated with them.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```objectivec
[[RudderClient sharedInstance] track:@"test_event"
                          properties:@{@"key":@"value", @"foo": @"bar"}]
```

All the events tracked by RudderStack are divided into three major Branch event categories:

- [Commerce events](https://help.branch.io/developers-hub/docs/tracking-commerce-content-lifecycle-and-custom-events#track-commerce-events)
- [Content events](https://help.branch.io/developers-hub/docs/tracking-commerce-content-lifecycle-and-custom-events#track-content-events)
- [Lifecycle events](https://help.branch.io/developers-hub/docs/tracking-commerce-content-lifecycle-and-custom-events#track-lifecycle-events)

### Commerce event mapping

The following table lists the mapping between the <Link to="/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/">RudderStack e-commerce events</Link> and the Branch events:

| RudderStack event           | Branch event        |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------ |
| `Product Added`             | `ADD_TO_CART`       |
| `Product Added to Wishlist` | `ADD_TO_WISHLIST`   |
| `Cart Viewed`               | `VIEW_CART`         |
| `Checkout Started`          | `INITIATE_PURCHASE` |
| `Payment Info Entered`      | `ADD_PAYMENT_INFO`  |
| `Order Completed`           | `ADD_PAYMENT_INFO`  |
| `Spend Credits`             | `SPEND_CREDITS`     |
| `Promotion Viewed`          | `VIEW_AD`           |

| `Reserve`                   | `RESERVE`           |

<div class="infoBlock">
RudderStack also maps the <code class="inline-code">Spend Credits</code> event to Branch's <code class="inline-code">SPEND_CREDITS</code>, although it is not directly a part of the e-commerce events.
</div>

### Content event mapping

The following table lists the mapping between the RudderStack events and the Branch Content events:

| RudderStack event     | Branch event      |

### Property mappings

The following table lists the mapping of the accepted RudderStack properties common to all the events:

| RudderStack property | Branch property     |
