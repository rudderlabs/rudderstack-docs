description: Send events to Google Analytics 4 using RudderStack web device mode.
---

RudderStack lets you send your event data to Google Analytics 4 destination via device mode using the native web SDK. It supports the `gtag` way of tagging in websites in device mode. 

You need to select `gtag.js` as the **Client Type** and enable **Use device-mode to send events** in the RudderStack dashboard to send events via device mode. For more information on device mode settings in the RudderStack dashboard, refer to the <Link to="/destinations/streaming-destinations/google-analytics-4/setting-up-google-analytics-4-in-rudderstack/">Setting up Google Analytics 4</Link> guide.

## Identify

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify/">`identify`</Link> call lets you identify a visiting user and associate them to their actions. It also lets you record the traits about them like their name, email address, etc.

User-ID is an advanced feature that lets GA4 present a cross-device, cross-platform view of your customers' behavior. Google Analytics 4 uses `userId` and `deviceId` \(GA's `cid` value from Universal Analytics terminology\) to identify users.

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm", {
  name: "Alex Keener",
  email: "alex@example.com",
})
```

In the above snippet, the `userId` will be set to `1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm` for Google Analytics and the name and email will be set as `user_properties`.

## Page
  
The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/page">`page`</Link> call lets you record your website's page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.

Google Analytics 4 `gtag` sends a `page_view` event to Google Analytics by default every-time it is loaded. You can also send `page_view` event to Google Analytics whenever you make an explicit `page()` call to RudderStack SDK.

RudderStack sends the following properties by default:

- `url` mapped to `page_location`
- `title` mapped to `page_title`
- `referrer` mapped to `page_referrer`

You can also make `page()` call with any custom and standard properties as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page({
  path: "/test_browser.html",
  url: "http://example.com/test_browser.html?param1=true",
  title: "Page Load",
  search: "?param1=true",
  referrer: "referrer",
})
```

## Track

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track">`track`</Link> call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.

A sample `track` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Track me")
```

RudderStack SDK sends the track event name and any properties as custom properties to Google Analytics 4.

<div class="infoBlock">
RudderStack SDK flattens the properties that are nested and not standard Google Analytics 4 properties before sending them to Google Analytics.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">
There are limits on the number of custom properties per event that can be sent to Google Analytics 4. The RudderStack SDK <strong>does not drop</strong> the payload based on these limits. If the events are don't show up in the debug view or in the Google Analytics dashboard reports, refer to <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9267744?hl=en">Google support page</a> to learn more about the collection limits.
