Before configuring Google Analytics 4 as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Google Analytics 4 by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**           | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :----- | :----- |
| **Device Mode**     | **Supported** | **-**  | **-**  |
| **Cloud Mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported**  | **Supported**  |

<div class="infoBlock">
To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</Link> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Google Analytics 4, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Google Analytics 4**.
2. Assign a name to your destination and click on **Continue**.

- **API Secret**: This field is required only for the cloud mode setup where you can enter the API Secret generated through the Google Analytics dashboard. It can be created in the Google Analytics dashboard under **Admin** > **Data Streams** > **Choose your stream** > **Measurement Protocol** > **Create**.

- **Client Type**: Select the client type as `gtag` or `Firebase` from the dropdown:
  - **`gtag`** - Supported for the cloud and device mode both. If you select `gtag`, enter the below:
    - **Measurement Id**: Enter the Measurement Id which is the identifier for a data stream. It can be found in the Google Analytics dashboard under **Admin** > **Data Streams** > **Choose your stream** > **Measurement ID**.
  - **`Firebase`** - Supported only for the cloud mode. If you select `Firebase`, enter the below settings:
    - **Firebase App Id**: Enter the Firebase App ID which is the identifier for Firebase app. It can be found in the Firebase dashboard under **Project Settings** > **General**.

### Identify

- **Enable Server Side Identify**: Enable this setting to make an <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify/">`identify`</Link> call.

If **Enable Server Side Identify** setting is enabled, you can also configure the following settings:

- **Trait to differentiate between new or existing user**: Enter a trait key to determine whether a user is new or an existing user.
- **Convert identify event to Login or Signup event**: Enable this setting to convert the `identify` event to a <Link to="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/reference/events#login">`login`</Link> event in case of an existing user or a <Link to="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/reference/events#sign_up">`sign_up`</Link> event in case of a new user.
- **Trait key for the 'method' parameter in Login or Signup event**: Enter the trait key to pass the `method` parameter in the <Link to="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/reference/events#login">`login`</Link> or <Link to="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/reference/events#sign_up">`signup`</Link> event.
- **Send 'generate_lead' event for 'identify' event**: Enable this setting to send a <Link to="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/reference/events#generate_lead">`generate_lead`</Link> event for a new user. 

  <div class="infoBlock">
  Note that the <code class="inline-code">generate_lead</code> event will only be fired for the new users and not for the existing ones.
  </div>

  When enabled and it is a new user, you also need to enter the following details:
  - **Value - traits for lead generation**: Enter the value key to pass the `value` parameter for the `generate_lead` event. 
  - **Currency - traits for lead generation**: Enter the currency key to pass the `currency` parameter for the `generate_lead` event.

### Native SDK

<div class="infoBlock">
All the settings mentioned below are applicable only for the device mode.
</div>

- **Block a Page View Event**: Enable this setting to disable sending `page_view` events on load. However, you can explicitly send a `page_view` event by calling the `page()` API.
- **Extend Page View Property**: Enable this setting to send the following properties along with any other custom property to the `page` call of the RudderStack SDK:
    - `url`
    - `search`
 
<div class="infoBlock">
Google Analytics 4 has a limit on the number of unique properties per event name. The default <code class="inline-code">page_view</code> event supports the properties mentioned in the <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9234069?hl=en&ref_topic=6317484">Automatically collected events in Google Analytics 4</a> guide.
</div>

**Send userId to GA**: This setting exhibits the following behavior:
  - If enabled, the user ID is set to the identified visitors and sent as explained in the [Cookies and user identification](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/devguides/cookies#set_user_id) guide.
  - If disabled, `userId` is not sent and Rudderstack only sends the user traits set as `user_properties` to Google Analytics. The user properties are set on the `gtag` client as explained in the [Set user properties](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/user-properties?technology=websites) guide.

### Client-side events filtering
