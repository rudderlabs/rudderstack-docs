Find the open source transformer code for this destination in the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/v0/destinations/am">GitHub repository</a>.
</div>

## Getting started

RudderStack supports sending event data to Amplitude via the following <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">connection modes</a>:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | **Supported** | **Supported** | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">
In the web device mode integration, that is, using <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk">JavaScript SDK</Link> as a source, the Amplitude native SDK is loaded from <code class="inline-code">https://cdn.amplitude.com/</code> domain. Based on your website's content security policy, you might need to <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#allowlist-destination-domain">allowlist this domain</Link> to load the Amplitude SDK successfully.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Amplitude, follow these steps:

1.  From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select Amplitude.
2. Assign a name to the destination and click on **Next**.

## Connection settings

To successfully configure Amplitude as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

- **API Key**: You can find the Amplitude API key in your [Amplitude dashboard](https://analytics.amplitude.com/login/).

<div class="infoBlock">
To get the API key, you need to create an organization and a project in Amplitude. For more information, refer to this <a href="https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/207108137-Quick-start-guide-Create-your-organization-and-first-project">Amplitude support page</a>. 
</div>

- **API Secret Key required for deletion of users**: Enter your API Secret Key required for user deletion.
- **Residency Server**: Based on the Amplitude data center you have configured, select the residency server from the below options:
  - **Standard Server**
  - **EU Residency Server** 

### Group settings

  - **Group name trait**: The trait that we will use as `groupType` in the `group` call.
  - **Group value trait**: The trait that we will use as `groupValue` in the `group` call.

### Track pages

<div class="infoBlock">

These settings can be used for tracking via web and mobile device mode only.
</div>

  - **Track all pages**: If this setting is enabled, an event named `Loaded a page` / `Loaded a Screen` will be sent to Amplitude.
  - **Track Categorized pages**: If this setting is enabled and if `category` is present in a `page` / `screen` call, then an event named `Viewed {category} page` / `Viewed {category} Screen` will be sent to Amplitude.
  - **Track Named pages**: If this setting is enabled and the `name` is present in a `page` call, then an event named `Viewed {name} page` will be sent to Amplitude.

<div class="infoBlock">

If <code class="inline-code">name</code> is present in a <code class="inline-code">screen</code> call, then RudderStack sends the event name as <code class="inline-code">Viewed {name} Screen</code> to Amplitude. However, if <code class="inline-code">name</code> is absent, then the event is sent as <code class="inline-code">Loaded a Screen</code>.
</div>

<div class="warningBlock">

If multiple settings are enabled, then multiple events may be sent for a single <code class="inline-code">page/screen</code> call. For example, if both <strong>Track categorized page</strong> and <strong>Track named page</strong> settings are enabled, one <strong>Viewed {name} page</strong> / <strong>Viewed {name} Screen</strong> and one <strong>Viewed {category} page</strong> / <strong>Viewed {category} Screen</strong> events will be generated for a single <code class="inline-code">page/screen</code> call.
</div>

### Trait settings

This setting is for configuring the traits sent to Amplitude via RudderStack's `identify` call.

  - **Traits to increment**: If this setting is enabled, the value of the corresponding trait will be incremented at Amplitude, with the value provided against the trait in an `identify` call.
  - **Traits to set once**: If this setting is enabled, the value of the corresponding trait will be set once at Amplitude with the value provided against the trait in an `identify` call.
  - **Traits to Append**: If this setting is enabled, the value of the corresponding trait will be appended to the corresponding trait array at Amplitude. **If the corresponding trait does not have a value set yet, it will be initialized to an empty list before the new values are appended. If the corresponding trait has an existing value and it is not a list, it will be converted into a list with the new value appended.**

<div class="infoBlock">

This feature is not applicable for the web device mode integration.
</div>

- **Traits to Prepend**: If this setting is enabled, the value of the corresponding trait will be prepended to the corresponding trait array at Amplitude. If the corresponding trait does not have a value set yet, it will be initialized to an empty list before the new values are prepended. If the corresponding trait has an existing value and it is not a list, it will be converted into a list with the new value prepended.

<div class="infoBlock">

This feature is not applicable for the web device mode integration.
</div>

### Other settings

- **Track Products once**: If this setting is enabled and if the event payload contains an array of products, then the event is tracked with the original event name and all the products as its property. Otherwise, each product is tracked with event as `Product purchased`.
- **Track Revenue per product**: If this setting is enabled and if the event payload contains multiple products, each product's revenue is tracked individually.
- **Version Name**: The value of this field is set as the `versionName` of the Amplitude SDK.

<div class="infoBlock">

This feature is applicable only for the web device mode integration.
</div>

- **Map device brand**: Enable this setting for RudderStack to send the device brand information (`context.device.brand`) to Amplitude.

<div class="infoBlock">

Amplitude computes <code class="inline-code">device_family</code> as <code class="inline-code">device_family: {device_brand} {device_manufacturer} {device_model}</code>.
</div>

### Client-side events filtering

<div class="infoBlock">
Refer to the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/">Client-side Event Filtering</Link> guide for more information on this setting.
</div>

### Web device mode settings

- **Batch events**: If this setting is enabled, the events are batched together and uploaded by the Amplitude SDK only when the number of queued events is greater than or equal to `eventUploadThreshold` or `eventUploadPeriodMillis` (in ms), since the first unsent event is queued.
- **Event upload period millis**: If the `batch events` settings is enabled, this is the amount of time that the SDK waits to upload the events.
- **Event upload threshold**: If the `batch events` settings is enabled, this is the minimum number of events to batch together by the Amplitude SDK.
- **Use device mode to send events**: Enable this flag to send the events through Amplitude web SDK. The other settings related to the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">device mode</Link>will also work if you enable this option.
- **Prefer Anonymous ID for Device ID**: If this setting is enabled, the Device ID will be set as the `anonymousId` generated by RudderStack SDK or by the value you explicitly set as the `anonymousId` via RudderStack's`setAnonymousId()` method. 

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on explicitly setting the <code class="inline-code">anonymousId</code>, refer to <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#overriding-anonymous-id">RudderStack's JavaScript SDK</Link> documentation.
</div>

- **Set Device ID from the URL parameter**: If this setting is enabled, the Amplitude SDK will parse the URL parameter and set the Device ID from `amp_device_id`.
- **Force HTTPS:** If this setting is enabled, the events will always be uploaded by the Amplitude SDK to the `HTTPS` endpoint, otherwise it will use the embedding site's protocol.
- **Track GCLID:** If this setting is enabled, the Amplitude SDK will capture the `gclid` URL parameters along with the user's `initial_gclid` parameters.
- **Track Referrer:** If this setting is enabled, the Amplitude SDK will capture the `referrer` and `referring_domain` for each session along with the user's `initial_referrer` and `initial_referring_domain`.
- **Track UTM properties:** If this setting is enabled, the Amplitude SDK parses the UTM parameters in the query string or `_utmz` cookie and includes them as user properties in all uploaded events.
- **Save Referrer, URL Params, GCLID once per session:** If this setting is enabled, the corresponding tracking of `gclid`, referrer, UTM parameters will be done once per session. 

<div class="infoBlock">

Disable this option if you always want to capture new values through the session.
</div>

- **Unset param referrer on new session:** If this setting is disabled, the existing `referrer` and `utm_parameter` values will be passed to each new session. If enabled, `referrer` and `utm_parameter` properties will be set to `null` upon instantiating a new session. 

<div class="infoBlock">

This feature works only if the <strong>Track Referrer</strong> and <strong>Track UTM properties</strong> settings are enabled in the dashboard.
</div>

## Page

The `page` call allows you to record information whenever a user sees a web page, along with the associated optional properties of that page. This method must be called at least once per page load.

A sample `page` call looks like the following:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page({
  userId: "user_id",
  category: "Category",
  name: "Sample",
})
```

In the above sample, we capture information related to the page being viewed such as the category of the page \(`Category`\), as well as the name of the page \(`Sample`\) along with the unique user ID.

## Screen

The `screen` method allows you to record whenever a user sees the mobile screen, along with any associated optional properties. This call is similar to the `page` call, but is exclusive to your mobile device.

A sample `screen` call looks like the following code snippet:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.screen({
  userId: "user_id",
  category: "Category",
  name: "Sample",
})
```

In the above snippet, we capture information related to the screen being viewed, such as screen's name and category.

## Track

The `track` call allows you to capture any action that the user might perform, and the properties associated with that action. Each action is considered to be an event.

A sample `track` call looks like the following:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Track me")
```

### Revenue events

Amplitude allows for tracking of revenue events.

<div class="warningBlock">

To track a revenue event, you must include a <code class="inline-code">revenue</code> key in the event. This key is required to have the event counted as a revenue event to send data through the RudderStack cloud mode.

</div>

Additionally, if you send `price` and `quantity` with the revenue key, the revenue will be calculated in Amplitude as `price * quantity`

You can also set a `product_id`, but only if `revenue` has been set as well.

A sample revenue track call looks like the following:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Item Purchased", {
  revenue: 30,
  revenue_type: "add-on purchase",
})
```

<div class="warningBlock">

To track revenue event in web device mode, we use Amplitude's <code class="inline-code">logRevenueV2()</code> api and also for an eCommerce event, we expect <code class="inline-code">revenue</code> as a top level attribute in properties. If <code class="inline-code">products</code> array is present in event payload, then to track product individually, at each product level <code class="inline-code">price</code> or <code class="inline-code">revenue</code>must be present, or else we will not track the revenue. As <code class="inline-code">logRevenueV2</code> uses both <code class="inline-code">price</code> and <code class="inline-code">quantity</code> to calculate the <code class="inline-code">revenue</code>, if no <code class="inline-code">quantity</code> is present, we will take default as <code class="inline-code">1</code>.

</div>

A sample eCommerce event \(`Order Completed`\) is as following:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Order Completed", {
  checkoutId: "ABCD1234",
  orderId: "order1234",
  revenue: 50,
  products: [
    {
      productId: "product1",
      sku: "45790-32",
      name: "Monopoly: 3rd Edition",
      price: 20,
      quantity: 1,
      category: "Games",
    },
    {
      productId: "product2",
      sku: "46493-32",
      name: "Uno Card Game",
      price: 15,
      quantity: 2,
      category: "Games",
    },
  ],
})
```

The above call will generate one `Order Completed` event, 2 individual `Product purchased` events and 2 revenue events \(one with `$price` as `15` and `$quantity` as `2` and the other one with `$price` as `20` and `$quantity` as `1` \) at Amplitude, provided that in the destination settings dashboard: `Track revenue per product settings` is enabled. The two separate revenue events are generated for device mode. For cloud mode, revenue will be tracked along with the 2 `Product purchased` events.

<div class="infoBlock">
To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</Link> guide.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">
<strong>Applicable for mobile only</strong>: If you set a property with the name <code class="inline-code">optOutOfSession</code> and value <code class="inline-code">true</code> then this <code class="inline-code">track</code> call will be opted out of the current session if it exists or does not start a new session if there isn't any active session.
</div>

## Identify

The `identify` call lets you associate a user with their actions and capture all the relevant traits about them. This information includes unique `userId` as well as any optional information such as name, email address, etc.

<div class="infoBlock">
When sending events from your <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/">Reverse ETL</Link> sources using the <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/features/visual-data-mapper/">Visual Data Mapping</Link> feature, you can also pass a custom user ID in your <code class="inline-code">identify</code> calls. RudderStack adds this ID under <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/blob/5d716c2df82fca2e76c3bb17de17b1cabe72126d/v0/destinations/am/transform.js#L270"><code class="inline-code">context.externalId.0.identifierType</code></a> before sending it to Amplitude.
</div>

A sample `identify` call looks like the following:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify(
  "userId", {
    email: "name@surname.com",
    name: "John Doe",
    profession: "Student",
  })
```

A sample dashboard after making the above `identify`, `page`, and `track` calls is as follows:

<img src="../../assets/screenshot-2020-02-17-at-5.41.41-pm.png" />

<img src="../../assets/screenshot-2020-02-17-at-5.49.05-pm.png" />

<div class="infoBlock">
<strong>Applicable for mobile only</strong>: If a trait with the name <code class="inline-code">optOutOfSession</code> and value <code class="inline-code">true</code> then this <code class="inline-code">identify</code> call will be opted out of the current session if it exists or does not start a new session if there isn't any active session.
</div>

### Deleting a user

You can delete a user in Amplitude using the <Link to="/api/data-regulation-api/#adding-a-suppression-with-delete-regulation">Suppression with Delete regulation</Link> of the RudderStack <Link to="/api/data-regulation-api/">Data Regulation API</Link>.

<div class="infoBlock">
To delete a user, you must specify their <code class="inline-code">userId</code> in the event. Additionally, you can specify a custom identifier (optional) in the event.
</div>

A sample regulation request body for deleting a user in Amplitude is shown below:

```json
{
  "regulationType": "suppress_with_delete",
  "destinationIds": [
    "2FIKkByqn37FhzczP23eZmURciA"
  ],
  "users": [{
    "userId": "1hKOmRA4GRlm",
    "<customKey>": "<customValue>"
  }]
}
```

## Group

<div class="warningBlock">
<a href="https://developers.amplitude.com/docs/group-identify-api">Groups</a> are an enterprise-only feature in Amplitude and you need to purchase the <strong><a href="https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001765532">Accounts</a></strong> add-on to use them.
</div>

The `group` call lets you associate a particular identified user with a group, such as a company, organization, or an account.

<div class="infoBlock">
RudderStack supports sending the <code class="inline-code">group</code> calls in the cloud mode. However, when sending events via the device mode, <code class="inline-code">group</code> is currently supported only by the web (JavaScript) SDK.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">
RudderStack does not support associating a user to more than one group per <code class="inline-code">group</code> API call sent to Amplitude. To send more than one group per user, you need to call the <code class="inline-code">group</code> API multiple times with the relevant group information specified in the <Link to="#group-settings">group settings</Link>.
</div>

To use the Amplitude Groups feature with RudderStack, you need to define the `Group name trait` and `Group value trait` in the dashboard settings and pass them as traits while making a `group` call.

Even if you don't have an enterprise account or the Groups add-on, RudderStack adds `groups` as a user property in the user's profile with <strong>Group Name Trait</strong> as its type and <strong>Group Value Trait</strong> as its value.

Suppose you have defined the <strong>Group Name Trait</strong> as `RS` and <strong>Group Value Trait</strong> as `RudderStack` and made the `group` call, then the user would be associated with the Group name: `RS` and the Group Value: `RudderStack`.
  
## Send `event_id` in device mode

RudderStack supports sending `event_id` to Amplitude in the device mode. You can include it under the `integrations` object and it is supported for all the above-mentioned API calls, namely, `identify`, `track`, `page`, `screen`, and `group`.
  
A sample `identify` call with `event_id` is as follows:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify(
  "1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm", {
    name: "Alex Keener"
  }, {
    integrations: {
      Amplitude: {
        event_id: 1234
      }
    }
  }
);
```

## Alias

<div class="infoBlock">
This feature is currently only available when sending events through the JavaScript SDK in the cloud mode.
</div>

Refer to the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#alias">JavaScript SDK documentation</Link> for information and examples on how to call the `alias` event.

### Mapping

Amplitude's `alias` call simply creates a mapping or link between the `user_id` specified in the `from` parameter to the `global_user_id` specified in the `to` parameter of the `alias` call.

```javascript
rudderanalytics.alias("user_id", "global_user_id", options, callback)
```

### Unmapping

With Amplitude, it is possible to **unmap** an already established link, or `alias`. In order to trigger Amplitude to unmap a connection, follow the code snippet template below.

```javascript
rudderanalytics.alias("user_id_to_unmapped", {
  integrations: {
    Amplitude: {
      unmap: true,
    },
  },
})
```

In the snippet above, `user_to_be_unmapped`, will be unmapped or unlinked from the `global_user_id` it is currently linked to.

<div class="infoBlock">
For the unmapping call, it is not necessary to provide <code class="inline-code">global_user_id</code> in the <code class="inline-code">to</code> parameter of the <code class="inline-code">alias</code> call. If it is included, RudderStack will dismiss this field.
</div>

For more information on how the `alias` call works for Amplitude, refer to this [Amplitude support page](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002750712-Portfolio-Cross-Project-Analysis#h_76557c8b-54cd-4e28-8c82-2f6778f65cd4).

## Reset

<div class="infoBlock">
This feature is currently available as a part of RudderStack Mobile SDKs only.
</div>

The `reset` method resets the previously identified user and related information.

## FAQ

### Why are all my session IDs `-1` in Amplitude?

Session tracking is only supported for the RudderStack <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">device mode</Link> because the integration loads Amplitude's SDK. 
Events sent via the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode">cloud mode</Link> connections will have session IDs as `-1`.

### Can I send more than one group per user to Amplitude?

RudderStack does not support associating a user to more than one group per `group` API call sent to Amplitude. To send more than one group per user, you need to call the `group` API multiple times with the relevant group information specified in the <Link to="#group-settings">group settings</Link>.
