  Step-by-step guide on sending your event data from RudderStack to Optimizely Feature Experimentation.
---

[Optimizely Feature Experimentation](https://www.optimizely.com/products/full-stack/) (formerly Optimizely Full Stack) is a powerful A/B testing, feature flagging and experimentation platform. It allows you to track every aspect of your customer's overall product journey, and experiment with various application features.

## Getting started

RudderStack supports sending events to Optimizely via the following <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">connection modes</Link>:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile**    | **Server** |
| :------------------ | :------ | :------------ | :--------- |
| **Device mode**     | **-**   | **Supported** | **-**      |
| **Cloud mode**      | **-**   | **-**         | **-**      |

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Optimizely, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Optimizely Full Stack**.
2. Assign a name to your destination and click **Continue**.

## Connection settings

To successfully configure Optimizely Feature Experimentation as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

- **Track Known Users**: Optimizely does not alias known and unknown users. Therefore, RudderStack will send the `anonymousId` to Optimizely by default if this setting is disabled. Otherwise, the `userId` will be sent.
- **Send the experiment and variation information as properties on a track call**: By enabling this setting, the experiment data can be sent to the other destinations as a `track` call. This is done by triggering the `Experiment Viewed` event every time an Optimizely live variable is accessed.
- **Specifies the experiment viewed as non interaction event for Google Analytics**: Enabling this option sends `Experiment Viewed` as a non-interaction event.

Configure the settings according to your requirements and click **Next** to complete the setup.

### Implementation Prerequisites

Unlike other destinations, Optimizely Feature Experimentation for the mobile integration works a little differently. You will have to implement some Optimizely functions natively to make sure the experiment logic runs correctly.

<div class="infoBlock">
RudderStack maps the <code class="inline-code">track</code> calls with Optimizely's <code class="inline-code">track</code> calls. You need to implement all the Optimizely's decision-based methods like <code class="inline-code">activate</code> and <code class="inline-code">isFeatureEnabled</code> natively. For more details, refer to Optimizely's <a href="https://blog.optimizely.com/2019/02/26/introducing-easy-event-tracking-the-easier-way-to-understand-and-optimize-the-customer-journey/">Easy Event Tracking</a> blog and the <a href="https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/docs/sdk-reference-guides#section-ios-and-tvos">Optimizely SDK reference Guide</a>.

        Follow these steps to add Optimizely to your Android Project:
<ol>
<li>Add the following <code class="inline-code">repository</code> to your <code class="inline-code">app/build.gradle</code> file.
<span>

```
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```
</span>
</li>
<li>After that, add the following <code class="inline-code">dependency</code> in the same file:
<span>

```
implementation 'com.rudderstack.android.integration:optimizely:0.1.1'
implementation 'com.optimizely.ab:android-sdk:3.0.0'
```
</span>
</li>
<li>Initialize the Optimizely Manager:

<div class="warningBlock">
Optimizely recommends initializing their SDK as soon as possible. You need to initialize the Optimizely Manager before proceeding to the next step. Refer to the Optimizely <a href="https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/docs/initialize-sdk-android">Initializing the SDK</a> guide for more information.
</div>
<span>

```
val optimizelyManager =  OptimizelyManager.builder()
            .withSDKKey(<YOUR OPTIMIZELY SDK KEY>)
            .build(this)
```
</span>
</li>
<li>Finally, change the initialization of your <code class="inline-code">RudderClient</code> in your <code class="inline-code">Application</code> class:
<span>

```
val rudderClient = RudderClient.getInstance(
    this,
    <YOUT_WRITE_KEY>,
    RudderConfig.Builder()
        .withEndPointUri(<YOUR_DATA_PLANE_URL>)
        .withFactory(OptimizelyIntegrationFactory.FACTORY(optimizelyManager)
        .build()
)
```
</span>

<div class="warningBlock">
Make sure you pass the Optimizely manager instance you created in the previous step to the factory as shown in the above snippet above.

      <TabPanel>
        Follow these steps to add Optimizely to your iOS project:
<ol>
<li>Go your <code class="inline-code">Podfile</code> and add the <code class="inline-code">Rudder-Optimizely</code> extension
<span>

```
pod 'Rudder-Optimizely'
```
</span>
</li>
<li>After adding the dependency followed by <code class="inline-code">pod install</code> , you can add the imports to your <code class="inline-code">AppDelegate.m</code> file as shown:
<span>

```
#import "RudderOptimizelyFactory.h"
```
</span>
</li>
<li>Finally, change the initialization of your <code class="inline-code">RudderClient</code> as shown:
<span>

```
RSConfigBuilder *builder = [[RSConfigBuilder alloc] init];
[builder withDataPlaneUrl:DATA_PLANE_URL];
// Setup optimizely logger.
OPTLYLoggerDefault *optlyLogger = [[OPTLYLoggerDefault alloc] initWithLogLevel:OptimizelyLogLevelAll];
// Create an Optimizely manager
 self.optlyManager = [[OPTLYManager alloc] initWithBuilder:[OPTLYManagerBuilder  builderWithBlock:^(OPTLYManagerBuilder * _Nullable builder) {
        builder.sdkKey = @<SDK KEY>;
        builder.logger = optlyLogger;
 }]];
[builder withFactory:[RudderOptimizelyFactory instanceWithOptimizely:self.optlyManager]];
[builder withLoglevel:RSLogLevelDebug];
[RSClient getInstance:WRITE_KEY config:[builder build]];
```
