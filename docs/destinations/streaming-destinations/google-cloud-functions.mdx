[Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions) is a Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) product that lets you run your code in the cloud without any servers or containers.

RudderStack supports Google Cloud Functions as a destination where you can send your event data seamlessly.

## Getting started

Before configuring Google Cloud Functions as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Google Cloud Functions by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     |  -             | -             | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      |  **Supported** | **Supported** |  **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">
To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</Link> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Google Cloud Functions, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Google Cloud Functions**.
2. Assign a name to the destination and click **Continue**.

## Connection settings

To successfully configure Google Cloud Functions as a destination, you need to configure the following settings:

- **Choose your Trigger Type**: From the dropdown, select **HTTP** or **HTTPS** depending on the trigger type configured for your cloud function.

<div class="infoBlock">
You can set the trigger type while configuring your cloud function. For more information, refer to the <Link to="#faq">FAQ</Link> section below.
</div>

- **Gcloud Authorization**: If you have selected **HTTPS** as your trigger type, enter your <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/securing/authenticating#authenticating_developer_testing">Google Cloud Authorization Token</a>.
- **URL**: Enter the URL obtained in the **Trigger** field during the cloud function setup.

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on obtaining the URL, refer to the <Link to="#how-do-i-create-a-google-cloud-function">FAQ</Link> below.
</div>

- **API Key ID**: Enter your API key ID. Refer to the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys">Google Cloud documentation</a> for more information on creating and using the API key.

<div class="infoBlock">
The API key ID is a string required by the cloud function to identify a request. RudderStack injects this key in the <code class="inline-code">ApiKey</code> header in case of both the <strong>HTTP</strong> and <strong>HTTPS</strong> trigger types.
</div>

- **Enable Batch Input**: Enable this setting to pass a batch input (array of events) to your cloud function.
- **Max Batch Size**: If **Enable Batch Input** setting is enabled, specify the maximum batch size in this field.

## Supported events
