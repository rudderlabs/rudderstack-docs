<div class="infoBlock">
RudderStack's SDKs do not calculate the value for any of the above properties like <code class="inline-code">revenue</code>, <code class="inline-code">value</code>, <code class="inline-code">total</code>, <code class="inline-code">subtotal</code>, etc. You must provide these values while triggering the <code class="inline-code">track</code> call. Also, RudderStack maps the values associated with these fields to the destination fields where you want to send the data. Hence, it is helpful to understand how these fields are defined in a specific destination.
