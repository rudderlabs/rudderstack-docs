The product reviewing lifecycle events are associated with the key activities that a customer might perform while adding a product review on your app or website.

This event is triggered whenever a customer reviews a product. The following properties are supported by this event:

| **Property Name** | **Type** | **Description of the Property**                                        |
| :---------------- | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `product_id`      | String   | Contains the ID of the product being reviewed                          |
| `review_id`       | String   | Contains the unique ID of the review being posted by the customer      |
| `review_body`     | String   | Contains the body or the content of the review posted by the customer  |
| `rating`          | String   | Contains the rating of the product added by the customer in the review |
