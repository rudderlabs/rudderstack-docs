description: Detailed technical description of the Track API call.
---

The `track` call lets you record the customer events, i.e. the actions that they perform, along with any properties associated with them.

<div class="infoBlock">
Each user action is called an event. Every event has a name associated with it, for example, <strong>Product Reviewed</strong>. This event might also have some properties associated with it, like <code class="inline-code">review_id</code> and <code class="inline-code">rating</code>.
</div>

<div class="successBlock">
For E-Commerce specific events, refer to our <Link to="/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/">E-commerce Events Specification</Link> guide.
</div>

## Sample payload

A sample payload for the `track` event after removing the common fields mentioned in the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/common-fields/">Common fields</Link> section is as shown:

```javascript
{
  "type": "track",
  "event": "Product Reviewed",
  "properties": {
    "review_id": "12345",
    "product_id" : "123",
    "rating" : 3.0,
    "review_body" : "Average product, expected much more."
  }
}
```

The corresponding event that generates the above payload via the <Link to="/sources/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/">JavaScript SDK</Link> is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Product Reviewed", {
  review_id: "12345",
  product_id: "123",
  rating: 3.0,
  review_body: "Average product, expected much more."
})
```

## Track fields

Apart from the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/common-fields/">Common fields</Link>, the `track` call accepts the following fields:

| **Field**    | **Type** | **Presence** | **Description**                                                                                                  |
| :----------- | :------- | :----------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `event`      | String   | Required     | Name of the user action.                                                                                         |
| `properties` | Object   | Optional     | Includes the properties associated with the event. For more information, check the <Link to="#properties">Properties</Link> section below. |

## Properties

Properties are additional contextual information that are associated with a `track` event, that give more clarity of your users' actions.

RudderStack has reserved some standard properties listed in the following table and handles them in a special manner.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align:left">
        <b>Property</b>
      </th>
      <th style="text-align:left">
        <b>Type</b>
      </th>
      <th style="text-align:left">
        <b>Description</b>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <code class="inline-code">revenue</code>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">Number</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>The revenue amount as a result of an event. For e.g., a product worth $20.00 would result in a <code class="inline-code">revenue</code> of <code class="inline-code">20.00</code>.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <code class="inline-code">currency</code>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">String</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>The currency of the revenue as a result of the event, set in ISO 4127 format. If this is not set, RudderStack assumes the revenue is in USD.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <code class="inline-code">value</code>
      </td>
      <td style="text-align:left">String</td>
      <td style="text-align:left">
        <p>An abstract value associated with an event, to be used by various teams.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<div class="successBlock">
  Different destinations recognize some of the above traits differently. For example, Mixpanel has a <code class="inline-code">track_charges</code> method for tracking revenue. With RudderStack, you don't have to worry about these inconsistencies. In this case, you can pass the <code class="inline-code">revenue</code> property and RudderStack will handle the conversion automatically.
