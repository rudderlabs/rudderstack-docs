description: Learn the app lifecyle events tracked out of the box by RudderStack SDKs.
---

RudderStack lets you track various application lifecycle events across the mobile SDKs and get insights into app-related metrics like installs, opens, etc. This guide provides the details and semantic definitions of these events and the associated properties.

<div class="infoBlock">
To track the application lifecycle events on the Android platform using the Unity SDK, you need to perform some additional steps. For more information on these steps, refer to the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-unity-sdk/#tracking-application-lifecycle-events-on-the-android-platform">Tracking application lifecycle events on the Android platform</Link> section.
</div>


## Supported lifecycle events

RudderStack **automatically tracks** the following application lifecycle events:

- <Link to="#application-installed">Application Installed</Link>
- <Link to="#application-opened">Application Opened</Link>
- <Link to="#application-updated">Application Updated</Link>
- <Link to="#application-backgrounded">Application Backgrounded</Link>

<div class="infoBlock">
To disable the auto-tracking of these events, set the <code class="inline-code">withTrackLifecycleEvents</code> parameter to <code class="inline-code">false</code> while initializing the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-android-sdk/">Android</Link> / <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-android-sdk/">Android</Link> SDK.
</div>

## Application Installed

This event is fired when a user opens an application for the first time after installation.

<div class="warningBlock">
RudderStack does not collect this event if the user does not open the app after installation.
</div>

A sample payload is shown below:

```json
{
  "type": "track",
  "event": "Application Installed",
  "properties": {
    "version": "11.1.7"
  }
}
```

RudderStack tracks the following properties for this event:

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--------| :-----| :------------|
| `version` | String | The version of the installed application. |

## Application Opened

This event is fired when a user launches an application after the first launch and subsequently every time the app is reopened after it is closed or backgrounded.

A sample payload is shown below:

```json
{
  "userId": "1hKOmRA4el9Z",
  "type": "track",
  "event": "Application Opened",
  "properties": {
    "from_background": false,
    "referring_application": "Whatsapp",
    "url": "https://www.estore.com/best-seller/1",
    "version": "11.1.7"
  }
}
```

<div class="infoBlock">
<code class="inline-code">userId</code> will be present only if the user is logged into the application, that is, an <code class="inline-code">identify</code> call is made previously.
</div>

RudderStack tracks the following properties for this event:

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--------| :-----| :------------|
| `from_background` | Boolean | Determines if the app was backgrounded initially or if it is a fresh open.  |
| `url`* | String | The deep linking URL with which the user was directed into the app. |
| `referring_application`* | String | The external application from which the user was referred to the app. |
| `version`* | String | The version of the installed application. |

There are some differences in the way the RudderStack SDKs handle the above event properties:

### Android SDK

- The properties marked with an asterisk (`url`, `referring_application`, `version`) are tracked and sent only if they are available on the first launch of the application.
- RudderStack also sends all the query parameters received as a part of the deep linking URL as key-value pairs in the `Application Opened` event properties.

### iOS SDK

- The properties marked with an asterisk (`url`, `referring_application`, `version`) are tracked and sent only if they are available on every application launch.

### Unity SDK

- The properties marked with an asterisk (`url`, `referring_application`, `version`) are not tracked either for Android or iOS.

### React Native SDK

| Platform | Expected behavior |
| :--------| :---|
| Android | RudderStack **does not track** the properties marked with an asterisk (`url`, `referring_application`, `version`). | 
| iOS | The properties marked with an asterisk are tracked only if they are available on every application launch. |

### Flutter SDK

| Platform | Expected behavior |
| :--------| :---|
| Android | **No properties** are tracked. | 
| iOS | The properties marked with an asterisk (`url`, `referring_application`, `version`)  are tracked only if they are available on every application launch. |

### Cordova SDK

| Platform | Expected behavior |
| :--------| :---|
| Android | Same behavior as the <Link to="#android-sdk">Android SDK</Link>. | 
| iOS | Same behavior as the <Link to="#ios-sdk">iOS SDK</Link>. |

## Application Updated

This event is fired when a user updates their application.

A sample payload is shown below:

```json
{
  "userId": "1hKOmRA4el9Z",
  "type": "track",
  "event": "Application Updated",
  "properties": {
    "previous_version": "11.1.7",
    "version": "12.0.1"
  }
}
```

RudderStack tracks the following properties for this event:

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--------| :-----| :------------|
| `previous_version` | String | The application version before it was updated.  |
| `version` | String | The current version of the application after it is updated. |


<div class="infoBlock">
For the Unity SDK, you need to perform the required steps for the Android and iOS platforms to trigger the <strong>Application Updated</strong> lifecycle event. For more information on these steps, refer to the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-unity-sdk/#triggering-application-updated-lifecycle-event">Triggering Application Updated lifecycle event</Link> section.
</div>

## Application Backgrounded

This event is fired when the user backgrounds the application.

A sample payload is shown below:

```json
{
  "userId": "1hKOmRA4el9Z",
  "type": "track",
  "event": "Application Backgrounded",
  "properties": {}
}
```

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack does not track any properties for this event.
</div>

## FAQ

### Do the application lifecycle events follow the standard timestamping format?

Yes, the lifecycle events follow the timestamp format in accordance with the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/common-fields/">RudderStack API Spec</Link>.

### Do the lifecycle events include the user traits or `context` objects?

The application lifecycle events include the `context` objects. Note that `userId` would be present only if the user is logged into the application, i.e. an `identify` call is made previously.
