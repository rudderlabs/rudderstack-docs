  Detailed technical description of the common fields that define the core event data structure.
---

The common fields define the core event data structure in RudderStack. These fields also contain vital information about the event and the source platform.

<div class="successBlock">
Every RudderStack API call shares the same common fields.
</div>

The following table lists all the common fields with their detailed description:

| Name                | Data type| Presence | Description                                                                             |
| :------------------ | :------- | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `anonymousId`       | String   | Required | Unique identification for the user. This is the same as the `deviceId`.                 |
| `channel`           | String   | Required | Identifies the source of the event. Permitted values are `mobile`, `web`, `server`.     |
| `context`           | Object   | Required | Contains all the additional user information. The RudderStack SDKs populate this information automatically. |
| `event`             | String   | Optional | Captures the user action that you want to record.                                       |
| `type`              | String   | Required | Captures the type of event. Values can be either `track`, `screen`, `identify`, `page`. |
| `integrations`      | Object   | Optional | You can specify the destinations for which you want to enable/disable sending events.   |
| `messageId`         | String   | Optional | Unique identification for the event.                                                    |
| `properties`        | Object   | Optional | Passes all the relevant information associated with the event.                          |
| `originalTimestamp` | DateTime | Required | Records the actual time when the event occurred. Make sure it conforms to the ISO 8601 date format `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ`. For e.g., `2022-02-01T19:14:18.381Z`.                                                                              |
| `sentAt`            | DateTime | Required | Captures the time when the event was sent from the client to RudderStack. Make sure it conforms to the ISO 8601 date format `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ`. For e.g., `2022-02-01T19:14:18.381Z`.                                                         |

<div class="infoBlock">
Upon receving the event, RudderStack also sets <code class="inline-code">receivedAt</code> - the timestamp when the event is ingested(received). You need not set this field explicitly when sending the events to RudderStack.
</div>

## Clock skew considerations

RudderStack considers the time at its end to be absolute and assumes any difference on the client-side. Thus, the client clock skew is relative.

<div class="infoBlock">
If not specified in the payload explicitly, RudderStack calculates <code class="inline-code">timestamp</code> based on <code class="inline-code">originalTimestamp</code> and <code class="inline-code">sentAt</code> to account for the client clock skew.
</div>

As mentioned in the above section:

| Field               | Description                                                                                                                    |
| :-------------------| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `originalTimestamp` | Records the actual time when the event occurred at the source.                                                                 |
| `sentAt`            | Captures the time when the event was sent from the client to RudderStack.                                                      |
| `receivedAt`        | The timestamp when the event is received(ingested) by the RudderStack server.                                                  |
| `timestamp`         | Calculated by RudderStack to account for the client clock skew, **IF** the user does not explicitly specify it in the payload. |

<div class="infoBlock">
<code class="inline-code">sentAt</code> &gt; <code class="inline-code">originalTimestamp</code> is <strong>always true</strong>. However, <code class="inline-code">timestamp</code> can be more or less than the <code class="inline-code">originalTimestamp</code>. Refer to the cases below for more details.
</div>

### Case 1: `originalTimestamp` < `receivedAt`

The following table demonstrates an example of `originalTimestamp` < `receivedAt`(when the client-side time is less than the time registered by RudderStack):

| originalTimestamp       | sentAt                  | receivedAt              | timestamp = receivedAt - (sentAt - originalTimestamp)    |
| :-----------------------| :-----------------------| :-----------------------| :--------------------------------------------------------|
| 2020-04-26 07:00:43.400 | 2020-04-26 07:00:45.124 | 2020-04-26 07:00:45.558 | 2020-04-26 07:00:44.834                                  |

In this case, `timestamp` will be **greater** than `originalTimestamp`.

### Case 2: `originalTimestamp` > `receivedAt`

The following table demonstrates an example of `originalTimestamp` > `receivedAt`(when the client-side time is more than the time registered by RudderStack):

| originalTimestamp       | sentAt                  | receivedAt              | timestamp = receivedAt - (sentAt - originalTimestamp)    |
| :-----------------------| :-----------------------| :-----------------------| :--------------------------------------------------------|
| 2020-04-26 07:00:45.558 | 2020-04-26 07:00:46.124 | 2020-04-26 07:00:43.400 | 2020-04-26 07:00:43.965                                  |

In this case, `timestamp` will be **less** than `originalTimestamp`.

## Contextual fields

The contextual fields give additional context about a particular event. The following table lists all the contextual fields with their detailed description:

| Name | Data type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `app` | Object | Gives detailed information related to your app, like `build`, `name`, `namespace` and `version`. |
| `device` | Object | Information about the device from which you are capturing the event. It contains `deviceId`, `manufacturer`, `model`, `name` and `type`. |
| `library` | Object | Details about the RudderStack SDK you are using, like `name` and `version`. |
| `locale` | String | Captures the language of the device. |
| `ip` | String | The user's IP address. |

| `userAgent` | String | The user agent of the device that you are tracking. |
