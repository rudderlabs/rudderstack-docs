description: Detailed technical description of the Alias API call.
---

The `alias` call lets you merge different identities of a known user.

<div class="infoBlock">
RudderStack supports sending <code class="inline-code">alias</code> events only to select downstream destinations. Refer to the <Link to="/destinations/streaming-destinations/">destination-specific documentation</Link> for more details.
</div>

<div class="warningBlock">
The <code class="inline-code">alias</code> call is used only for merging user identitites. It does not update the user's <code class="inline-code">traits</code> or other common properties.
</div>

## `alias` fields

In addition to the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/common-fields/">Common Fields</Link>, the `alias` call accepts the following fields:

| Field | Description | Data type | Presence |
| :-----| :-----------| :----------| :---------|
| `userId` | The user's unique identifier in the database. Either `userId` or `anonymousId` should be present. | String | Optional, if `anonymousId` is already set. |
| `previousId` | The user's previous identifier. | String | Required |

### `userId` vs `previousId`

- The `previousId` attribute refers to the previous user identifier. It could be either:
  - An `anonymousId` assigned to the user \(by the browser if the user is a new visitor or has not logged in yet, or the session ID if you're using a server-side SDK\).
  - A previously set `userId` to identify the user via the `identify` call.
- The `userId` is the user's new identity or an existing identity that you want to merge with `previousId`.

## Sample payload

A sample payload of an `alias` call is shown below:

```javascript
{
  "type": "alias",
  "previousId": "name@surname.com",
  "userId": "12345"
}
```

The corresponding event that generates the above payload via the <Link to="/sources/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/">JavaScript SDK</Link> is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.alias("12345")
```

<div class="infoBlock">
The RudderStack SDK automatically passes the user's <code class="inline-code">anonymousId</code> as <code class="inline-code">previousId</code> in the payload.
</div>

<div class="warningBlock">
When instrumenting your website with the JavaScript SDK, the <code class="inline-code">alias</code> call must be made from the client-side as the <code class="inline-code">anonymousId</code> is generated via the browser. Similarly, if you're using a server-side SDK, the <code class="inline-code">alias</code> call must be made from the server-side as the session ID is set as the <code class="inline-code">anonymousId</code>.
