  Detailed technical description and semantic definitions of the event data
  captured by the various RudderStack APIs.

The **RudderStack Event Spec** helps you plan your event data and provides various options for tracking your events across all the RudderStack SDKs and APIs.

<div class="successBlock">
RudderStack has a unified event semantic for different destination platforms. You can easily translate your event data to different downstream tools by following this spec.
</div>

## Supported API calls

The RudderStack API Spec supports the following calls, each answering a pertinent question about the user:

| **API call**          |**Description**             |
| :-------------------- |:-------------------------- |
| <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify/">Identify</Link>  | Captures the visiting user's details.  |
| <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/page/">Page</Link>  | Captures the details related to the web page that the user is currently on.               |
| <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/screen/">Screen</Link>  | Captures the details related to the app screen that the user is currently viewing.    |
| <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track/">Track</Link>  | Captures information related to the user's actions.                                     |
| <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/group/">Group</Link>  | Captures details about the group or organization that the user is a part of. |
| <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/alias/">Alias</Link>  | Lets you merge different identities of a known user.                   |
| <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/merge/">Merge</Link> | Lets you perform <Link to="/features/identity-resolution/">identity resolution</Link> by associating different identifiers to a given customer profile in the warehouse. | 
| **Reset**              | Resets the information related to the previously identified user.                         |

## How the API calls work

Here's a quick overview of how the API calls mentioned above work:

1. When the user makes the API calls, the event data is sent to the RudderStack backend.
2. RudderStack transforms this event data into a destination-specific format.
3. The transformed data is then forwarded to the required destination.

## Event data format

The event data collected by RudderStack has a JSON structure, which has the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/common-fields/">Common fields</Link> and an API-specific payload.

<div class="dangerBlock">
<strong>It is strongly recommended to pass large integer values in your events as strings</strong>. This is to ensure that the values are correctly transmitted to all the systems(including various downstream destinations) without any issues.<br /><br />

RudderStack uses a JSON library that has an <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7159#section-6">upper limit of 2 <sup>53</sup> for integers</a>. If the values you pass in your events exceed this number, the library <strong>automatically truncates it</strong>. Furthermore, certain downstream destinations might have their own limitations on parsing such integer values.
