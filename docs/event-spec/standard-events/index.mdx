The **RudderStack Event Spec** helps you plan your event data and provides various options for tracking your events across all the RudderStack SDKs and APIs.

<div class="successBlock">
RudderStack has a unified event semantic for different destination platforms. You can easily translate your event data to different downstream tools by following this spec.

## Supported API calls

The RudderStack API Spec supports the following calls, each answering a pertinent question about the user:

## How the API calls work

Here's a quick overview of how the API calls mentioned above work:

1. When the user makes the API calls, the event data is sent to the RudderStack backend.
2. RudderStack transforms this event data into a destination-specific format.
3. The transformed data is then forwarded to the required destination.

## Event data format

The event data collected by RudderStack has a JSON structure, which has the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/common-fields/">Common fields</Link> and an API-specific payload.
