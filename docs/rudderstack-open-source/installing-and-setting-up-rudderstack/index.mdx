# Data Plane Setup

The data plane is RudderStack's core engine responsible for processing and routing the events.

<div class="infoBlock">

  For more information on the data plane, refer to RudderStack's <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/rudderstack-architecture/#data-plane">Architecture</a>.
</div>

## Setup instructions

Based on the platform where you want to set up RudderStack, refer to the setup instructions:

If you are planning to use RudderStack in production, it is strongly recommended to use the <a href="kubernetes/">Kubernetes</a> Helm charts. The Docker images are updated with the latest bug fixes more frequently than the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server">GitHub repository</a>.

## Sending test events

Once you have installed RudderStack, follow the [Sending Test Events](sending-test-events/) guide to verify your installation.

## FAQ

### Do I need to sign up for an account to set up open source RudderStack?

Signing up for [RudderStack Open Source](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup?type=opensource) is the easiest way to set up and manage your data pipelines. The web app is only used for source/destination configuration and does not have access to your data. It also provides a [Live Events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/live-events/) feature for debugging purposes, only for a limited time. 

**RudderStack does not persist any of your data**.

However, if you do not wish to sign up for RudderStack and want to self-host the source/destination configurations, you can use the open source [Control Plane Lite](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-open-source/control-plane-lite/) utility. To set up the RudderStack server (backend) in your own environment, follow the steps listed in the [Setup instructions](#setup-instructions) section for your preferred platform.

<div class="warningBlock">

The control plane set up using Control Plane Lite does not have features like <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/transformations">Transformations</a> and the ability to view <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/live-events/">live events</a>.
</div>

### What is a data plane URL? Where do I get it?

For routing and processing the events to the RudderStack backend, a **data plane URL** is required.

<div class="infoBlock">

  Refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/rudderstack-architecture">RudderStack Architecture</a> guide for more information the RudderStack data plane.
</div>

If you're using open source RudderStack, you are required to set up your own data plane by [installing and setting up RudderStack](#setup-instructions) in your preferred environment.

<div class="infoBlock">

An open source RudderStack data plane URL typically looks like <code class="inline-code">http:localhost:8080</code>, where <code class="inline-code">8080</code> is the port where your RudderStack data plane is hosted.
</div>

### How to check the status of the data plane?

To check the status of your data plane, run the following command:

```bash
CURL <DATA_PLANE_URL>/health
```

A sample command is shown below:

```bash
CURL https://hosted.rudderlabs.com/health
```

You will see the following output:

```
{"server":"UP", "db":"UP","acceptingEvents":"TRUE","routingEvents":"TRUE","mode":"NORMAL","goroutines":"15364", "backendConfigMode": "API", "lastSync":"2020-12-01T04:20:33Z", "lastRegulationSync":"2020-11-30T21:40:27Z"}
```

The RudderStack server (backend) supports two running modes:

- **Normal** (`"mode": "NORMAL"`): In this mode, the RudderStack server runs as expected and there are no issues.
- **Degraded** (`"mode": "DEGRADED"`): RudderStack enters the degraded mode if it keeps crashing while processing the events after a threshold number of restarts is reached. RudderStack still receives and stores the events in this mode but does not process them and route them to your specified destinations.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the supported running modes, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/user-guides/administrators-guide/high-availability/">RudderStack High Availability</a> guide.
