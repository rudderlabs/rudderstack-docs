  Detailed technical documentation on using RudderStack’s Java SDK to send
  events to various destinations.
---

RudderStack’s Java SDK allows you to track your customer event data from your Java applications and send it to your specified destinations via RudderStack.

Check out the [**GitHub codebase**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-java) to get a more hands-on understanding of the SDK.

/>

## SDK setup requirements

To set up the RudderStack Java SDK, the following prerequisites must be met:

- You need to set up a [**RudderStack account**](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup).
- Once signed up, <Link to="/dashboard-guides/sources/#adding-a-source">set up a Java source</Link> in the dashboard. You should be able to see a **Write Key** for this source, as shown below:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-sources/java-write-key.png" alt="Java source write key" />

- You will also need a data plane URL. Refer to the <Link to="/resources/glossary/#data-plane-url">Glossary</Link> for more information on the data plane URL and where to find it.

<div class="successBlock">
The <strong>Setup</strong> tab in the RudderStack dashboard (seen above) has an SDK installation snippet containing both the write key and the data plane URL. You can use it to integrate the Java SDK into your application.
</div>

## Installing the Java SDK

<div class="warningBlock">

<strong>As Bintray has sunset from 1st may, 2021, we're moving our SDK to Maven Central. All the versions from 1.0.1 will now be available in Maven Central only.</strong>
</div>

We distribute our Java SDK through [**Maven Central**](https://search.maven.org). The recommended and easiest way to add the SDK to your project is through the Maven build system.

To install the RudderStack Java SDK, add the following lines of code to `pom.xml`:

```markup
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.rudderstack.sdk.java.analytics</groupId>
     <artifactId>analytics</artifactId>
   <version>2.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

If you're using Gradle, add the below to your dependencies:
```markup
implementation 'com.rudderstack.sdk.java.analytics:analytics:2.0.0'
```


## Initializing the RudderStack client

To initialize the RudderStack client, run the following code snippet:

```java
RudderAnalytics analytics = RudderAnalytics.builder(
        WRITE_KEY,
        DATA_PLANE_URL
).build();
```

## Sending events from the RudderStack client

Once the RudderStack client is initialized, you can use it to send relevant customer events from the RudderStack client.

<div class="warningBlock">

RudderStack does not store the user state in any of the server-side SDKs. Unlike the client-side SDKs that deal with only a single user at a given time, the server-side SDKs deal with multiple users at the same time. Therefore, for any of the calls supported by the Java SDK, you need to specify either `userId` or `anonymousId` every time.
</div>

A sample `track` call is as shown:

```java
Map<String, Object> properties = new LinkedHashMap<>();
    properties.put("key1", "value1");
    properties.put("key2", "value2");
    analytics.enqueue(
       TrackMessage.builder("Java Test")
           .properties(properties)
           .anonymousId(anonymousId)
           .userId(userId)
);
```

## Identify

The `identify` call lets you identify a visiting user and capture any related information such as their name, email address, etc.

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```java
analytics.enqueue(IdentifyMessage.builder()
    .userId("f4ca124298")
    .traits(ImmutableMap.builder()
        .put("name", "Sample Name")
        .put("email", "sample@abc.com")
        .build()
    )
);
```

The `identify` method parameters are as described below:

## Track

The `track` call lets you record the user actions along with their associated properties. Each user action is called an **event**.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```java
Map<String, Object> properties = new LinkedHashMap<>();
    properties.put("key1", "value1");
    properties.put("key2", "value2");
    analytics.enqueue(
       TrackMessage.builder("Java Test")
           .properties(properties)
           .anonymousId(anonymousId)
           .userId(userId)
);
```

The `track` method parameters are as described below:

| Name           | Type   | Presence | Description                                                                                                                |

## Screen

The `screen` call is the mobile equivalent of the `page` call. It allows you to record the screen views on your mobile app along with the other relevant information about the app screen.

A sample `screen` call is as shown:

```java
analytics.enqueue(ScreenMessage.builder("Schedule")
    .userId("f4ca124298")

## Group

The `group` call lets you associate an identified user to a group - either a company, project or a team and record any custom traits or properties associated with that group.

A sample `group` call is as shown:

```python
analytics.enqueue(GroupMessage.builder("group123")
    .userId("f4ca124298")
    .traits(ImmutableMap.builder()

    )
);
```

The `group` method parameters are as follows:

| **Field**      | **Type** | **Presence**                              | **Description**                                                                                                            |

## Alias

The `alias` call allows you to associate one identity with another.

<div class="infoBlock">

<code class="inline-code">alias</code> is an advanced method that lets you change the tracked user's ID explicitly. This method is useful when managing identities for some of the downstream destinations.
</div>

A sample `alias` call is as shown:

```java
analytics.enqueue(AliasMessage.builder("previousId")
    .userId("newId")
);
```

The `alias` method parameters are as mentioned below:

| **Field**      | **Type** | **Presence**                              | **Description**                                                                                                       |
| :------------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `userId`       | String   | Optional, if `anonymousId` is already set | Unique identifier for a particular user in your database.                                                             |
| `context`      | Object   | Optional                                  | Dictionary of information that provides context about a message. However, it is not directly related to the API call. |
| `integrations` | Object   | Optional                                  | A dictionary containing the destinations to be either enabled or disabled.                                            |
| `previousId`   | String   | Required                                  | The previous unique identifier of the user.                                                                           |

</div>

## Block flush

<div class="infoBlock">

This feature is only available from version <code class="inline-code">1.0.1</code> onwards.
</div>

If you want to block `flush` until all the events are uploaded , the Java SDK has a builder method called `synchronize()` with default value `false` which needs to be set to `true` .

An example for blocking the `flush` is shown:

```java
RudderAnalytics analytics = RudderAnalytics.builder(
        WRITE_KEY,
        DATA_PLANE_URL
)
// optional (default : false)
// Required to block further method invocation until the flush completes.
.synchronize(true);

// optional. Used for Logging
.plugin(new PluginLog());

// optional. Available from 2.0.0
//Sets the queue size at which flushes should be triggered.
.maximumQueueSizeInBytes(100); //maximum queue size

// optional. Available from 2.0.0
//Sets how many retries should happen before getting exhausted.
.retries(10); //number of retries

.build();

// ...YOUR CODE...

// optional. Triggers a flush and block until the flush completes.
// Required in case of Synchronize.
// It calls implicitly the `flush` method.
// So, explicit `flush` call is not required.
analytics.blockFlush();
analytics.shutdown(); // Shut down after the flush is complete.
```

## FAQs

### Can I use the `ImmutableMap` class?

Yes. You need to use the Guava library. You can also use the plain old Java Maps instead.
