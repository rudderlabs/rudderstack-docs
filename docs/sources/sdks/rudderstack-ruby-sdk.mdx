  Detailed technical documentation on using RudderStackâ€™s Ruby SDK to send
  events to various destinations.
---

The **RudderStack Ruby SDK** lets you track your customer event data from your Ruby code and send it to your specified destinations via RudderStack.

Check out the [**GitHub codebase**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-ruby-sync) to get a more hands-on understanding of the SDK.

  repo={'gem/v/rudder_analytics_sync'}
  style={'flat'}
/>

## SDK setup requirements

To set up the RudderStack Ruby SDK, the following prerequisites must be met:

- You need to set up a [**RudderStack account**](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup).
- Once signed up, <Link to="/dashboard-guides/sources/#adding-a-source">set up a Ruby source</Link> in the dashboard. You should be able to see a **Write Key** for this source, as shown below:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-sources/ruby-write-key.png" alt="Ruby source write key" />

- You will also need a data plane URL. Refer to the <Link to="/resources/glossary/#data-plane-url">Glossary</Link> for more information on the data plane URL and where to find it.

<div class="successBlock">
The <strong>Setup</strong> tab in the RudderStack dashboard (seen above) has an SDK installation snippet containing both the write key and the data plane URL. You can use it to integrate the Ruby SDK into your application.
</div>

## Installing the Ruby SDK

To install the RudderStack Ruby SDK, add this line to your application's Gem file:

```ruby
gem 'rudder_analytics_sync'
```

You can also install it yourself, as shown:

```bash
gem install rudder_analytics_sync
```

## Using the SDK

To use the SDK, create a client instance as shown in the following snippet:

```ruby
require 'rudder_analytics_sync'

Analytics = RudderAnalyticsSync::Client.new(
  write_key: WRITE_KEY, # required
  data_plane_url: DATA_PLANE_URL
  on_error: proc { |error_code, error_body, exception, response|
    # defaults to an empty proc
  }
)
```

You can then use this client to send event requests, as shown:

```ruby
Analytics.track(
  user_id: user.id,
  event: 'Created Account'
)
```

### Manually batching events

You can manually batch events with `Analytics.batch` as shown:

```ruby
Analytics.batch do |batch|
  batch.context = {...}       # shared context for all events
  batch.integrations = {...}  # shared integrations hash for all events
  batch.identify(...)
  batch.track(...)
  batch.track(...)
  ...
end
```

## Identify

The `identify` call lets you identify a visiting user and capture any related information such as their name, email address, etc.

<div class="warningBlock">

RudderStack does not store the user state in any of the server-side SDKs. Unlike the client-side SDKs that deal with only a single user at a given time, the server-side SDKs deal with multiple users at the same time. Therefore, for any of the calls supported by the Node.js SDK, you need to specify either `userId` or `anonymousId` every time.
</div>

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```ruby
Analytics.identify(
  user_id: '12345',
  traits: { email: "#{ username.email }", friends: 1 },
  context: {ip: '10.81.20.10'}
)
```

The `identify` method parameters are as shown:

| :------------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `anonymousId`  | String   | Optional                                  | Sets the user ID for cases where there is no unique identifier for the user. Either `userId` or `anonymousId` is required. |

| `traits`       | Object   | Optional                                  | Dictionary of the traits associated with the user, such as `name`or `email`.                                               |

## Track

The `track` call lets you record the user actions along with their associated properties. Each user action is called an **event**.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```ruby
Analytics.track(
  user_id: '12345',
  event: 'Item Sold',
  properties: { revenue: 9.95, shipping: 'Free' }
)
```

## Page

The `page` call allows you to record the page views on your website along with the other relevant information about the viewed page.

A sample `page` call is as shown:

```ruby
Analytics.page(
  user_id: userid,
  category: 'Food',
  name: 'Pizza',
  properties: { url: 'https://dominos.com' }
)
```

The `page` method parameters are as described below:

| **Field**      | **Type** | **Presence**                              | **Description**                                                                                                            |

## Group

The `group` call lets you associate an identified user to a group - either a company, project or a team and record any custom traits or properties associated with that group.

A sample `group` call is as shown:

```ruby
Analytics.group(
  user_id: '12345',
  group_id: '12',
  traits: { name: 'Company', description: 'Software'}
)
```

The `group` method parameters are as follows:

## Alias

The `alias` call lets you merge different identities of a known user.

<div class="infoBlock">

<code class="inline-code">alias</code> is an advanced method that lets you change the tracked user's ID explicitly. This method is useful when managing identities for some of the downstream destinations.
</div>

A sample `alias` call is as shown:

```ruby
Analytics.alias(previous_id: '12345', user_id: '123')
```

The `alias` method parameters are as mentioned below:

| **Field**      | **Type** | **Presence**                              | **Description**                                                                                                       |
| :------------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `userId`       | String   | Optional, if `anonymousId` is already set | Unique identifier for a particular user in your database.                                                             |
| `context`      | Object   | Optional                                  | Dictionary of information that provides context about a message. However, it is not directly related to the API call. |
| `integrations` | Object   | Optional                                  | A dictionary containing the destinations to be either enabled or disabled.                                            |
| `previousId`   | String   | Required                                  | The previous unique identifier of the user.                                                                           |
| `traits`       | Object   | Optional                                  | Dictionary of the properties or traits associated with the group, such as `email` or `name`.                          |
| `timestamp`    | Date     | Optional                                  | The timestamp of the message's arrival.                                                                               |
