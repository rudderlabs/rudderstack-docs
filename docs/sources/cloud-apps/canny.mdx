## Event transformation

RudderStack ingests the events from Canny after converting them into the RudderStack event format. It also maps the following properties from the Canny event payload to the RudderStack properties:

| Canny property  | RudderStack property| Notes |
| :------------------ | :------------- |:------------- |
| `created`  | `timestamp`,`originalTimestamp`    | - |
| `object`        | `properties`        | -|
| `objectType`        | `properties.objectType`        | -|
| `type`    | `event`  | -|
| `object.author.userId`     | `userId`   |- |
| sha256 hash of(`object.author.email`)        | `anonymousId` | Only if `userId` is not present |
| sha256 hash of(`object.voter.email`)        | `anonymousId` |Only if `userId` is not present AND `type`is `vote.created`/`vote.deleted`|
| `object.voter.userId`    | `userId`  | Only if `type`is `vote.created`/`vote.deleted` |
| `object.voter.id`        | `context.externalId[0].value` | Only if `type`is `vote.created`/`vote.deleted`|
| `cannyUserId`    | `context.externalId[0].type`  |- |

## How RudderStack creates the event payload

This section details how RudderStack receives the data from Canny source and creates the resulting payload.

A sample payload sent by Canny is shown below:

```json
{
    "created": "2022-07-28T10:52:46.294Z",
    "object": {
        "author": {
            "created": "2022-07-15T11:16:32.648Z",
            "email": "alex@example.com",
            "id": "1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm",
            "isAdmin": true,
            "name": "Alex Keener",
            "url": "https://rudder.canny.io/admin/users/alex-keener",
            "userID": null
        },
        "board": {
            "created": "2022-07-25T12:11:19.895Z",
            "id": "VJIVo4GRlm",
            "name": "features",
            "postCount": 13,
            "url": "https://rudder.canny.io/admin/board/features"
        },
        "by": null,
        "category": null,
        "commentCount": 0,
        "created": "2022-07-28T10:52:46.172Z",
        "customFields": [{
            "id": "62e1382",
            "name": "John",
            "value": "123"
        }],
        "details": "Array of images",
        "eta": null,
        "id": "62e26a",
        "imageURLs": [
            "https://canny.io/images/6371453a825c79351c52a6063c3af476.jpg",
            "https://canny.io/images/47db6ee5035bfb45ea87a74f2eb17928.jpg"
        ],
        "owner": null,
        "score": 1,
        "status": "open",
        "tags": [],
        "title": "Custom Fields Testing",
        "url": "https://rudder.canny.io/admin/board/features/p/custom-fields-testing"
    },
    "objectType": "post",
    "type": "post.created"
}
```

RudderStack transforms the above payload into the following payload:

```json
