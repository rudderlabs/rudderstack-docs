  Learn about different event source types offered by RudderStack, namely Event Streams, Cloud Extract, and Reverse ETL.

The event data originates via a **source** in RudderStack. The most common event sources are your apps and web properties, but can include third-party cloud apps, server integrations, and even your own data warehouse.

The following sections provide more detail on the available source types, with links to the setup guides for each source.

## Event Streams

RudderStack's <Link to="/sources/event-streams/">Event Streams</Link> feature lets you collect event data from all your sites and applications and route it to a wide array of customer tools and data warehouses.

### SDKs

RudderStack provides open source <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/">SDKs</Link> for web, mobile, and server applications:

#### Web

Track customer event data from your website and web apps and send it to the specified destinations:

<Sources
  category={'web'}
/>

#### Mobile

Use native mobile SDKs for the mobile operating systems and development frameworks:

<Sources
  category={'mobile'}
/>

#### Server

Use server-side SDKs to track event data from your backend applications and send it to the specified destinations:

<Sources
  category={'server'}
/>

### Cloud Apps

RudderStack lets you ingest event data from your <Link to="/sources/event-streams/cloud-apps/">cloud apps</Link> and route it to the desired destinations.

<Sources
  category={'webhook'}
/>

## Cloud Extract

With RudderStack <Link to="/sources/extract/">Cloud Extract</Link>, you can collect the raw events and data from different cloud tools such as Facebook Ads, Google Analytics, Marketo, HubSpot, Stripe, and more. You can then build efficient ELT pipelines from these cloud apps to your data warehouse.

<Sources
  type={'extract'}
/>

## Reverse ETL

With RudderStack's <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/">Reverse ETL</Link> capabilities, you can use your data warehouse as a data source. You can tap into your warehouse data and enrich data pipelines elsewhere in your stack, for enhanced customization, personalization, and targeting.

<Sources
  type={'reverse ETL'}
/>

## API

It is recommended to use a native SDK for tracking and routing user events from your sources. RudderStack's SDKs offer automatic tagging of user context, event batching, and retry functionality during delivery failure.

If you don't see a supported SDK or library for your environment, you can send your data directly to the RudderStack <Link to="/api/http-api/">HTTP API</Link>.
