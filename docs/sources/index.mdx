## Cloud Extract

With RudderStack Cloud Extract, you can collect your raw events and data from different cloud tools such as Facebook Ads, Google Analytics, Marketo, HubSpot, Stripe, and more. You can then build efficient ELT pipelines from these cloud apps to your data warehouse.

For cloud apps that don't provide a streaming situation, do cloud extract.

## API

If possible, we recommend you use a native SDK for tracking and routing user events from your sources. Our SDKs offer automatic tagging of user context, event batching, and retry functionality during delivery failure.

If we don't offer a supported library for your environment, you can send your data directly to the RudderStack <Link to="/api/http-api/">HTTP API</Link>. 

## Web

JavaSript, obviously.
