RudderStack Audiences enables you to build and activate customer lists with easy-to-use filters on data warehouse tables. This builds on top of our Reverse ETL product, which sends warehouse data to these same systems but with no filters.

What is an audience?
- Subset of all the users of a product that have same traits. 
Use- Marketing teams run Campaigns for different audiences to grow usage of the product as well as retain Users

Audiences are customer lists that satisfy a set of criteria and are used to activate data downstream in email, SMS, digital advertising and CRM systems.

Audience builder tool
- Its a Visual Tool used to define Audiences easily without any knowledge of SQL or how the data is stored
Use a Table in warehouse to build audience. 
Select Column, Operator and Values to filter on
Combine Conditions using AND / OR operator
View Generated SQL, Check Preview Data and Audience Size

Uses/Benefits

Even though most downstream tools already have their own Audience Builder, we believe that there is immense value in bringing audience-building upstream to the CDP layer (RudderStack). Here teams can 

(1) create a single audience for multiple downstream systems

(2) guarantee that they are consistent across systems

(3) analyze the results of multichannel campaigns in a single place at the data warehouse. 

Most importantly, audiences in the warehouse allow our customers to trust the data they are working with and have full control over their ecosystem. Once Audiences are created, they can be sent to any RudderStack-supported destination through our Reverse ETL product.

Syncing audience to multiple downstream tools for running ads and campaigns from different platforms is very time consuming to do manually . 
Keeping them updated is also a challenge as the number of destinations grow.
There is no clear source of truth for Audience data especially when working with multiple tools
Difficult to debug issues while building audience in proprietary tools . We donâ€™t know if Data is wrong, Conditions are wrong or tool itself has issues
Marketing teams would need to work with SQL and  warehouses or rely on Data engineers to help with querying and syncing audiences. Either way this will slow down the process and add friction.
