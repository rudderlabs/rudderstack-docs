  Detailed guide on custom SQL models and how to create, update, and fetch their details in the RudderStack dashboard.
---

RudderStack's **Models** feature lets you create models by defining custom SQL queries. You can then run these queries on your warehouse and send the resulting data to specific destinations. 

<div class="infoBlock">
RudderStack supports this feature for the following Reverse ETL sources:
<ul>
<li><Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/amazon-redshift/">Amazon Redshift</Link></li> 
<li><Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/google-bigquery/">Google BigQuery</Link></li>
<li><Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/postgresql/">PostgreSQL</Link></li>
<li><Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/snowflake/">Snowflake</Link></li>
</ul>
</div>

## Creating a model

Follow these steps to create a model:

1. Log in to the <a href="https://app.rudderstack.com/">RudderStack dashboard</a>.
2. From the left navigation bar, go to **Enhance** > **Models** and click **New model**.

4. Enter a name for the model.
5. Select your existing warehouse credentials or click on **Create Credentials from Scratch** and enter the warehouse-specific details.
 
<div class="warningBlock">

Your warehouse account must have the necessary user permissions for RudderStack to access it. For more information on these user permissions, refer to the <strong>Granting Permissions</strong> section of the relevant <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/">Reverse ETL</Link> source.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">
Once you select or add your warehouse credentials and click on <strong>Next</strong>, RudderStack will validate them before you can proceed with the setup. For more information on these validations, refer to the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section below.
</div>

6. Next, enter the **Description** for the model. Then, add your custom SQL query in the **Query** section. 
7. Click on **Run Query** to preview the result.

<div class="infoBlock">

The <strong>Preview</strong> section displays the preview of the 50 resultant rows in a paginated format.
</div>

8. Click on **Next** to create the model.

<div class="infoBlock">
Once a model is created, you can use it to send the data from a Reverse ETL source to a specified destination. For more information and detailed steps, refer to the <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/common-settings/importing-data-using-models/">Importing Data using Models</Link> guide.
</div>

## Updating an existing model

Follow these steps to update an existing model:

1. Click the model you want to update and select the **Configuration** tab.
2. Click on **Edit Configuration** and make the required changes in  **Description** and **Query**.
3. If you have edited the query, click on **Run Query** to see if the new query generates the desired result.
4. Finally, click on **Finish** to save your changes.

<div class="infoBlock">
  
If you update a model's query, you also need to check and update the relevant JSON mapping or <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/features/visual-data-mapper/">Visual Data Mapping</Link>. To validate if the query is running fine, you can manually trigger a full sync.
</div>

## Model details

To get details about an existing model, you can click on it to see the options listed below:

- **Rename**: Lets you rename the model by clicking on the edit icon next to the model's name.

<img src="../../../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/model-rename.png" alt="Rename model" />

- **Sources**: Displays the sources associated with the model. To know more on how to use a model with a source, refer to the <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/features/models/">Setting Up Connections Using Models</Link> guide.
- **Configuration**: Displays and lets you edit the SQL **Query** and **Description**.
- **Settings**: This option contains the following two settings:

   - **Permanently delete the model**: Lets you delete the model by clicking on the **Delete** button. The **Delete** button is only enabled when no source is using the model.
   - **Credentials**: Lets you edit the credentials used for the model.

<div class="infoBlock">

After editing the credentials, it is recommended to validate the query by running it and fetching the preview via the <strong>Configuration</strong> tab as explained in the <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/features/models/#updating-an-existing-model">Updating an existing model</Link>section above.
</div>

## FAQ

### What do the three validations under Verifying Credentials imply?

When setting up a Reverse ETL source, once you proceed after entering the connection credentials, you will see the following three validations under the **Verifying Credentials** option:

<img src="../../../assets/validations.png" alt="Verifying Credentials" />

These options are explained below:

* **Verifying Connection**: This option indicates that RudderStack is trying to connect to the warehouse with the information specified in the connection credentials. 

<div class="warningBlock">

If this option gives an error, it means that one or more fields specified in the connection credentials are incorrect. Verify your credentials in this case.
</div>

* **Able to List Schema**: This option checks if RudderStack is able to fetch all the schema details using the provided credentials. 
* **Able to Access RudderStack Schema**: This option implies that RudderStack is able to access the RudderStack schema that you have created by successfully running the commands in the **User Permissions** section of the relevant <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl">Reverse ETL source</Link>. 

<div class="warningBlock">

If this option gives an error, verify if you have successfully created the RudderStack schema and given RudderStack the required permissions to access it.
</div>
