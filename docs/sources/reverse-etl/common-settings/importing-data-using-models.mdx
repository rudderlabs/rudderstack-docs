description: Detailed technical description on importing data using RudderStackâ€™s Models feature.
---

RudderStack's **Models** feature lets you define and run custom SQL queries on your warehouse data and send the results to your specified destinations.

<div class="infoBlock">

You can create a model in the RudderStack dashboard and use it while connecting a Reverse ETL source to a destination. For detailed steps on how to create a model, refer to the <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/features/models/">Models</Link> guide.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">
  
  This guide is applicable for Reverse ETL sources configured using the <strong>Model</strong> option. If you have configured your Reverse ETL source using the <strong>Table</strong> option, refer to the <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/common-settings/importing-data-using-tables/">Importing Data using Tables</Link> guide.
</div>

The settings to import and sync data from your model are listed below:

1. Select the required model from the dropdown list.

<div class="infoBlock">
  
The dropdown will only display the list of models corresponding to the Reverse ETL source you have configured. For example, only the BigQuery models will be listed for a BigQuery warehouse source.
</div>

2. Select the **Sync mode** that RudderStack will use to sync your data.

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack supports two modes for syncing your data - <strong>Upsert</strong> and <strong>Mirror</strong>. For more information on these modes, refer to the <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/common-settings/sync-modes/">Sync Modes</Link> guide.
</div>   

3. Select least one user identifier (**user_id/anonymous_id**) from the dropdown list.

You can also preview the data snippet which RudderStack will send to the destination. All the resulting columns from running the model's query are selected by default. However, you can choose to retain specific columns by searching and selecting them. You can then preview the resulting JSON on the right, as shown:

<img src="../../../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/models-data-snippet.png" />

<div class="infoBlock">
  
Alternatively, you can map the columns using the <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/features/visual-data-mapper/">Visual Data Mapper</Link> feature. However, note that this feature is currently supported only for selective destinations.
  
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">
  
The JSON payload carries the <code class="inline-code">user_id</code> and <code class="inline-code">anonymous_id</code> from the columns selected in the <strong>Choose user identifier</strong> section. Moreover, the traits are used from the columns selected in the <strong>Column</strong> section.
</div>

## Add Constant

You can also use the **Add Constant** option to add a constant key-value pair which is always sent in the JSON payload, as shown:

<img src="../../../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/add-constant.png" />

The new constant will appear in the table and also in the JSON preview inside the traits, as shown:

<img src="../../../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/add-constant-in-json.png" />

You can also use the dot notation to define a constant, as shown:

<img src="../../../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/dot-notation-constant.png" />

Once you have finalized the configuration, click on **Save**.

## Updating an existing configuration 

You can update the selection of columns from which RudderStack sends data to the specified destinations by following these steps:

1. Click on the source and select the **Schema** tab.
2. Then, click on the **Update** button, as shown:

<img src="../../../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/update-table-selection.png" />

3. Update your column selection.

<div class="warningBlock">

When updating an existing configuration, you can only change the existing mappings. The <strong>Model</strong>, <strong>Sync mode</strong>, and the <strong>User identifier</strong> fields are not editable. 
</div>

4. Finally, click on the **Save** button.

<div class="infoBlock">

After updating the configuration, the next sync will be a full sync.
</div>
