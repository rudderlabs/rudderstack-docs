[ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.tech/) is an open-source, column-oriented database management system mainly used for online analytical processing \(OLAP\). It lets you generate analytical reports that are updated in real-time using SQL queries. ClickHouse is highly scalable, fast, and built for high performance.

RudderStack supports ClickHouse as a source from which you can ingest data and route it to your desired downstream destinations.

### Naming the source

1. Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).
2. From the left panel, go to **Source** > **New Source** > **Reverse ETL**.  Then, select **ClickHouse**, as shown:

RudderStack lets you schedule data syncs for your Reverse ETL sources and specify how and when the syncs will run. For more information on the <strong>Basic</strong>, <strong>CRON</strong>, and <strong>Manual</strong> schedule types, refer to the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/common-settings/sync-schedule-settings/">Sync Schedule Settings</a> guide.

2. After specifying the schedule type and run settings, click **Continue** to finish the setup.

ClickHouse is now successfully configured as a source in your RudderStack dashboard. You can further connect this source to your preferred destination by clicking on **Add Destination** button, as shown:

If you have already configured a destination in RudderStack, choose the <strong>Use Existing Destination</strong> option which will take you to the <strong>Schema</strong> tab in the source settings. To add a new destination from scratch, select the <strong>Create New Destination</strong> option which will take you to the destination configuration page.
