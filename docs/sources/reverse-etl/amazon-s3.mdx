description: Sync data from Amazon S3 to your preferred destination via RudderStack.
---

[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is a cloud-based object storage service that lets businesses securely store their data at scale.

## Setting up the S3 source

1. Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com).
2. From the left panel, go to **Directory** > **Sources** > **Reverse ETL**. Then, select **Amazon S3**.
3. Assign a name and click **Continue**.

### Connection credentials

Configure the following settings to authenticate RudderStack to access your S3 account: 

- **Connection Mode**: RudderStack provides the following options to connect to S3:
  - **Cross-Account Role (recommended)**: This option lets you connect to S3 through an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_cross-account-with-roles.html">IAM access role</a>. To do so, you need to first create an IAM role for RudderStack with the required permissions to access your S3 account. Refer to the <Link to="#creating-the-rudderstack-iam-role">Creating the RudderStack IAM Role for S3</Link> section below for the detailed steps.
  - **Access Key**: This option lets you connect to S3 using your AWS access key ID and secret access key.

<div class="warningBlock">
It is highly recommended to use the <strong>Cross-Account Role</strong> method for connecting to S3 as the <strong>Access Key</strong> method will be deprecated soon.
</div>

- **Account Name**: Specify a name that will be used to identify the connection account.
- **Role ARN**: If you select the **Cross-Account Role (recommended)** connection mode, specify the ARN after <Link to="#creating-the-rudderstack-iam-role">creating the RudderStack IAM role</Link>.
- **AWS Access Key ID**: If you select the **Access Key** connection mode for authenticating RudderStack, specify your AWS access key ID. For more information on obtaining your access key ID and secret access key, refer to the <Link to="#faq">FAQ</Link> section below.
- **AWS Secret Access Key**: Enter the corresponding secret access key.

### S3 permissions

The **minimum** S3 permissions that need to be attached to IAM role or the access keys (depending on your connection method) are listed below:

```json
"Action": [
  "s3:GetObject",
  "s3:ListBucket"
],
```

### Schedule settings

Specify the **Schedule Settings** to schedule the data syncs from your S3 source.

<div class="infoBlock">
RudderStack lets you schedule data syncs for your Reverse ETL sources and specify how and when the syncs will run. For more information on the <strong>Basic</strong>, <strong>CRON</strong>, and <strong>Manual</strong> schedule types, refer to the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/common-settings/sync-schedule-settings/">Sync Schedule</a> guide.
</div>

### Connecting to a destination

Once you successfully set up your S3 source, you can connect it to your preferred destination by clicking the **Add Destination** button, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/destination.png" alt="Add destination in RudderStack" />

## Specifying the data to import

While configuring the destination, specify the following bucket configuration settings needed for RudderStack to import the data and sync it to the connected destination:

- **S3 Bucket Name**:  Enter the name of the S3 bucket.
- **Prefix**:  Prefix refers to the path within your S3 bucket from where RudderStack will import the data. For example, if **Prefix** is set to `RUDDER`, then RudderStack will import the data stored in the location `<your_s3_bucket>/RUDDER`.

<img src="../../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/s3-bucket-settings.png" alt="Bucket configuration settings" />

<div class="warningBlock">
Your S3 bucket (with the prefix, if specified above) should only consist of Apache Parquet files as Rudderstack can extract only the Parquet files. Also, the first row of the Parquet file should not have a <code class="inline-code">null</code> value (empty strings are allowed) for any column. It helps RudderStack to determine the correct schema of the file.
</div>

- **Choose user identifier**: Choose a user identifier for `user_id` and/or `anonymous_id` from the dropdown.

Once you specify the above settings, you will be able to preview a snippet of your data, as shown below:

<img src="../../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/models-data-snippet.png" alt="Data snippet preview" />

Here, you can select all or only specific columns of your choice, search the columns by a keyword, and also edit the **JSON Trait Key**. You can also preview the resulting JSON on the right.

- **Add Constant**: You can use this option to <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/common-settings/importing-data-using-tables#add-constant">add a constant key-value pair</a> which is always sent in the JSON payload, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/add-constant.png" alt="Add constant option in RudderStack dashboard" />

<div class="infoBlock">
As an alternative to JSON mapping, you can send the data to the destination using the <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/features/visual-data-mapper/">Visual Data Mapper</Link> feature. However, this feature is currently supported only for selective destinations.
</div>

## Updating an existing configuration

1. Go to the **Schema** tab of your configured source and click **Update**.
2. Update your column selection.

<div class="warningBlock">
When updating the configuration, you can only change the existing mappings. The <strong>S3 Bucket Name</strong>, <strong>Prefix</strong>, and <strong>User Identifier</strong> fields are not editable.
</div>

3. Finally, click the **Save** button.

<div class="infoBlock">
After updating the configuration, the next sync will be a full sync.
</div>

      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
