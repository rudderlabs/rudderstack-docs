title: "Audiences"
description: Build audiences on the warehouse sources and activate them in the downstream destinations
---

**Audiences** are customer lists that satisfy a specific set of criteria out of all the users of a product. RudderStack's **Audiences** feature lets you create these target customer lists with easy-to-use filters on your warehouse tables. Once created, you can activate them in any RudderStack-supported destination connected to the warehouse. 

For example, you can create audiences and send that data to the downstream digital advertising destinations to:

- Retarget all users from California in order to improve repeat sales.
- Prompt your active customers to buy the season tickets.
- Run campaigns to grow usage of the product as well as retain users.

## Benefits

RudderStack provides much value by providing the audience-building capabilities in its Reverse ETL pipeline where you can: 
- Create and sync single audience to multiple downstream systems which is very time consuming to do manually.
- Analyze the results of multichannel campaigns in a single place at the data warehouse. 
- Trust the audience data as a single source of truth and have full control over the ecosystem.
- Fastrack the process for Marketing teams who would otherwise need to work with SQL and warehouses or rely on Data engineers to help with querying and syncing audiences.
- Stop worrying about keeping the audiences updated or debugging issues while building audiences in proprietary tools.

## Build Audiences

RudderStack provides a visual **Audience builder tool** in its dashboard which can be used to build audiences easily without any prior knowledge of SQL or how to store the data.
