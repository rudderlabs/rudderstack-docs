description: Step-by-step guide to ingest your data from Amazon Redshift into RudderStack.
---

[Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) is one of the fastest cloud data warehouse services. It allows you to handle large analytical workloads with best-in-class performance, speed, and efficiency.

RudderStack supports Amazon Redshift as a source from which you can ingest data and route it to your desired downstream destinations.

## Granting permissions

RudderStack requires you to grant certain user permissions on your Amazon Redshift warehouse to successfully access data from it.

Run the queries listed in the following sections on **Amazon Redshift Console** in the **exact** order to grant these permissions:

### Step 1: Creating a new user in Redshift

1. Create a new user `rudder` with a password `<strong_unique_password>`.

```sql
CREATE USER rudder WITH PASSWORD '<strong_unique_password>'
```

#### Password considerations for Redshift

The password set in the above command must meet the following conditions:

* It should be **8-64** characters in length.
* It must contain atleast one upper case, one lower case, and one number.
* It can contain any ASCII characters with the ASCII codes 33-126, with the exception of `'` \(single quotation mark\), `"` \(double quotation mark\), `\`, `/`, and `@`.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the password rules, refer to [**Amazon Redshift documentation**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_CREATE_USER.html#r_CREATE_USER-parameters).
</div>

### Step 2: Creating the RudderStack schema and granting permissions

1. Create a dedicated schema `_rudderstack`.

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA "_rudderstack";
```

<div class="warningBlock">

The <code class="inline-code">_rudderstack</code> schema is used by RudderStack for storing the state of each data sync. Hence,  its name <strong>should not</strong> be changed.
</div>

2. Grant full access to schema `_rudderstack` for the user `rudder`.

```sql
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA "_rudderstack" TO rudder;
```

3. Grant full access to the user `rudder` over all the `_rudderstack` schema objects.

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA "_rudderstack" TO rudder;
```

### Step 3: Granting permissions on your schema and table

1. Grant access to the user `rudder` to look up the objects within your schema `<YOUR_SCHEMA>`.

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "<YOUR_SCHEMA>" TO rudder;
```

2. Grant access to the user `rudder` to read data from required table `<YOUR_TABLE>`.

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE "<YOUR_SCHEMA>"."<YOUR_TABLE>" TO rudder;
```

**Replace `<YOUR_SCHEMA>` and `<YOUR_TABLE>` with the exact names of your Redshift schema and table respectively**.

#### Optional commands

* The following command grants access to the user `rudder` to view and read data from **all** the tables present in the schema `<YOUR_SCHEMA>`:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA "<YOUR_SCHEMA>" TO rudder;
```

<div class="warningBlock">

Run the above command only if you're okay with RudderStack being able to access the data in all the tables residing within your specified schema.
</div>

* The following command grants access to the user `rudder` to read data from all the future tables in the schema `<YOUR_SCHEMA>`:
 
```sql
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA "<YOUR_SCHEMA>" GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO rudder;
```

<div class="warningBlock">

Run the above command only if you're okay with RudderStack being able to access the data in all the future tables residing within your specified schema.
</div>

**Replace `<YOUR_SCHEMA>` with the exact name of your Redshift schema.**

## Setting up the Redshift source in RudderStack

To set up Redshift as a source in RudderStack, follow these steps:

### Naming the source

1. Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderlabs.com/signup?type=freetrial).
2. From the left navigation bar, go to **Source** > **New Source** > **Reverse ETL**. Then, select **Redshift**, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/select-source.png" alt="Select Reverse ETL source in RudderStack" />

3. Assign a name to the source.

### Configuring the connection credentials

1. Choose the relevant option from **Table** or **Model** to use the source to sync data from either a warehouse table or a model.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the difference between the <strong>Table</strong> and <strong>Model</strong> options when creating a Reverse ETL source, refer to the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section below.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">
 
If you have chosen the <strong>Model</strong> option, skip the next steps and refer to the <a href="#schedule-settings">Schedule settings</a> section directly.
</div>

2. Enter the relevant settings in the **Connection Credentials** section as listed below:

<img src="../../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/redshift-connection-settings.png" />

- **Host** - Host name of your Redshift service.
- **Port** - Port number of your Redshift service.
- **Database -** Database name in your Redshift instance where the data is loaded.
- **User** - Username which has the required read/write access to the above database.
- **Password** - Password for the above user.
- **SSL Mode**: Choose the SSL mode through which RudderStack will connect to your Redshift instance. RudderStack provides two options - **disable** and **require**. For more information on these options, refer to the [FAQ](#faq) section below.

<div class="successBlock">

If you've configured Redshift as a source before, you can select the existing credentials under the <strong>Use existing credentials</strong> option.
</div>

3. Click on **Continue** to verify your credentials. RudderStack will then verify and validate your credentials. 

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on these validation steps, refer to the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section. 
</div>

4. Once verified, click on **Continue** to proceed.

### Schedule settings

1. Specify the **Schedule Settings** to schedule the data syncs from your Redshift instance.

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack lets you schedule data syncs for your Reverse ETL sources and specify how and when the syncs will run. For more information on the <strong>Basic</strong>, <strong>CRON</strong>, and <strong>Manual</strong> schedule types, refer to the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/common-settings/sync-schedule-settings/">Sync Schedule Settings</a> guide.
</div>

2. After specifying the schedule type and run settings, click on **Continue** to finish the setup.

Redshift is now successfully configured as a source in your RudderStack dashboard. You can further connect this source to your preferred destination by clicking on **Add Destination** button, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/destination.png" alt="Add destination in RudderStack" />

<div class="infoBlock">
  
If you have already configured a destination in RudderStack, choose the <strong>Use Existing Destination</strong> option which will take you to the <strong>Schema</strong> tab in the source settings. To add a new destination from scratch, select the <strong>Create New Destination</strong> option which will take you to the destination configuration page.
</div>

## Specifying the data to import

While connecting a destination to your Reverse ETL source, you can use the default JSON mapping or the [Visual Data Mapping](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/reverse-etl/features/visual-data-mapper/) feature.

<div class="infoBlock">

Based on the option(Table/Model) you chose while setting up the Reverse ETL source, follow the relevant guide for detailed steps:

## FAQ

### What are the SSL mode options when setting up the Redshift source in RudderStack?

When setting up a Redshift source, RudderStack provides the following two SSL options:

- **disable**: SSL mode is disabled when you select this option. Use it in cases where security is not an issue and you don't want any encryption overhead.
- **require**: When you select this option, your data is encrypted and sent to RudderStack. Use it in cases where security is important and you can deal with the resulting encryption overhead.

### What do the three validations under Verifying Credentials imply?

When setting up a Reverse ETL source, once you proceed after entering the connection credentials, you will see the following three validations under the **Verifying Credentials** option:

<img src="../../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/validations.png" alt="Validations" />

These options are explained below:

* **Verifying Connection**: This option indicates that RudderStack is trying to connect to the warehouse with the information specified in the connection credentials. 

<div class="warningBlock">

If this option gives an error, it means that one or more fields specified in the connection credentials are incorrect. Verify your credentials in this case.
</div>

* **Able to List Schema**: This option checks if RudderStack is able to fetch all the schema details using the provided credentials. 
* **Able to Access RudderStack Schema**: This option implies that RudderStack is able to access the `_RUDDERSTACK` schema you have created by successfully running all the commands in the [**User Permissions**](#step-2-creating-the-rudderstack-schema-and-granting-permissions) section. 

<div class="warningBlock">

If this option gives an error, verify if you have successfully created the <code class="inline-code">_RUDDERSTACK</code> schema and given RudderStack the required permissions to access it. For more information, refer to <a href="#step-2-creating-the-rudderstack-schema-and-granting-permissions">Creating the RudderStack schema and granting permissions</a> section.
</div>

### What is the difference between the Table and Model options when creating a Reverse ETL source?

When creating a new Reverse ETL source, you are presented with the following two options from which RudderStack will sync the data:

<img src="../../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/table-model-options.png" />

- When you choose **Table**, RudderStack imports all the data associated with the specified table during the sync.
- When you choose **Model**, RudderStack imports the data by running the query specified in the connected model, during the sync.
