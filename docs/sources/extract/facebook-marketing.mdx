[Facebook Marketing](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-apis/overview) is a HTTP-based API that lets you programmatically query your data, create and manage your ads, and perform many other tasks.

<div class="warningBlock">
All the Cloud Extract sources support sending data only to a <Link to="/destinations/warehouse-destinations/">data warehouse destination</Link>.

## Getting started

To set up Facebook Marketing as a source in RudderStack, follow these steps:

1. Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).
2. Go to **Sources** > **New source** > **Cloud Extract** and select **Facebook Marketing** from the list of sources.
3. Assign a name to your source and click **Continue**.

### Connection settings

2. Then, configure the following settings:

- **Account ID**: Enter the Facebook Ads account ID that RudderStack uses to pull the data from the Marketing API.
- **Start Date**: Specify the date from which RudderStack should replicate the data for all the incremental streams. RudderStack will **not** sync any historical data generated before this date.
- **End Date**: RudderStack syncs all the data generated between **Start Date** and this date. If you do not specify this date, RudderStack will sync all the latest available data.
- **Include Deleted**: Enable this setting to include the data from all the deleted campaigns, ads, and ad sets.
- **Fetch Thumbnail Images**: Enable this setting to fetch and store the thumbnail data for each [Ad Creative](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/creative/).
- **Custom Insights**: This setting lets you add a list containing the ad insights entries. You can specify the following configuration settings by clicking the **Add Item** button:

- **Allow Empty Action Breakdowns**: Enable this setting to allow action breakdowns to be an empty list.

### Destination settings

The following settings specify how RudderStack sends the data ingested from Facebook Marketing to the connected warehouse destination:

- **Table prefix**: RudderStack uses this prefix to create a table in your data warehouse and loads all your Facebook Marketing data into it.
- **Schedule Settings**: RudderStack gives you three options to ingest the data from Facebook Marketing:
    - **Basic**: Runs the syncs at the specified time interval. 
    - **CRON**: Runs the syncs based on the user-defined CRON expression.
    - **Manual**: You are required to run the syncs manually.

<div class="infoBlock">

## FAQ

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes - RudderStack implements a feature wherein it associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
