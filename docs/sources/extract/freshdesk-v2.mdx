[Freshdesk](https://freshdesk.com/) is a popular customer support software which provides cutting-edge, cross-channel customer support features including bots and various other self-service solutions.

This document guides you in setting up Freshdesk as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Freshdesk data, which can then be routed to your RudderStack-supported data warehouse destination.

All the Cloud Extract sources support sending data only to a <Link to="/destinations/warehouse-destinations/">data warehouse destination</Link>.
</div>

## Getting Started

To set up Freshdesk as a source in RudderStack, follow these steps:

1. Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).
2. Go to **Sources** > **New source** > **Cloud Extract** and select **Freshdesk V2** from the list of sources.
3. Assign a name to your source and click **Continue**.

### Connection settings

To set up Freshdesk as a Cloud Extract source, you need to configure the following settings:

<img src="../../assets/cloud-extract-sources/freshdesk-connection-settings.png" alt="Freshdesk credentials" />

- **Domain**: Enter your Freshdesk domain from the URL (for example, `test.freshdesk.com`).
- **API Key**: Enter your Freshdesk API key. Refer to the <Link to="#faq">FAQ</Link> section for more information on obtaining the API key.
- **Requests per minute**: Enter the number of requests that Freshdesk can use per minute. The rate limit **does not allow** more than 50 requests per minute per app per Freshdesk account.
- **Start Date**: Enter the date from which RudderStack should import your historical Freshdesk data.

### Destination settings

The following settings specify how RudderStack sends the data ingested from Freshdesk to the connected warehouse destination:

- **Table prefix**: RudderStack uses this prefix to create a table in your data warehouse and loads all your Freshdesk data into it.
- **Schedule Settings**: RudderStack gives you three options to ingest the data from Freshdesk:
    - **Basic**: Runs the syncs at the specified time interval. 
    - **CRON**: Runs the syncs based on the user-defined CRON expression.
    - **Manual**: You are required to run the syncs manually.

### Selecting the data to import

You can choose the Freshdesk data you want to ingest by selecting the required resources:

<div class="infoBlock">
The above-mentioned resources supporting the <strong>Incremental</strong> sync mode also support the <strong>Full Refresh</strong> sync mode by default but RudderStack syncs the data using the <strong>Incremental</strong> mode for such resources. If you want to use the <strong>Full Refresh</strong> sync mode for such resources, <a href="mailto:%20support@rudderstack.com">contact the RudderStack team</a>. For more information on the <strong>Full Refresh</strong> and <strong>Incremental</strong> sync modes, refer to the <Link to="/sources/extract/common-settings/#sync-modes">Common Settings</Link> guide.

Freshdesk is now configured as a source. RudderStack will start ingesting data from Freshdesk as per your specified schedule and frequency.

You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Add Destination**, as shown:

<div class="successBlock">
Use the <strong>Use Existing Destination</strong> option if you have an already-configured data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data warehouse destination from scratch, select the <strong>Create New Destination</strong> button.

### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
