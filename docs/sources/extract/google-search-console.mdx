[Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) is Google's web service that allows webmasters to check the indexing status of websites and optimize their visibility. It offers tools and reports to measure and optimize your website's search traffic, performance, content, and fix issues.

This document guides you in setting up Google Search Console as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your Google Search Console data and routes it to your specified data warehouse destination.

<div class="infoBlock">
If you are using a domain property in the Google Search Console, you must prefix the site URL with <code class="inline-code">sc-domain:</code>. For example, if the website URL is <code class="inline-code">http://www.example.com/</code>, then <code class="inline-code">http://www.example.com/</code> is a URL-prefix property and <code class="inline-code">sc-domain:example.com</code> is a domain property.
</div>

- **Start Date**: Specify the date from which RudderStack should import your Google Search Console data.
- **End Date**: Specify the date till which RudderStack should import your Google Search Console data .

<div class="warningBlock">

### Destination settings

The following settings specify how RudderStack sends the data ingested from Google Search Console to the connected warehouse destination:

- **Table prefix**: RudderStack uses this prefix to create a table in your data warehouse and loads all your Google Search Console data into it.
- **Schedule Settings**: RudderStack gives you three options to ingest the data from Google Search Console:
    - **Basic**: Runs the syncs at the specified time interval. 
    - **CRON**: Runs the syncs based on the user-defined CRON expression.
    - **Manual**: You are required to run the syncs manually.

<div class="infoBlock">

</div>

### Selecting the data to import

You can choose the Google Search Console data you want to ingest by selecting the required resources:

## FAQ

### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
