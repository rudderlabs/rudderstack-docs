[Freshdesk](https://freshdesk.com/) is a popular customer support software which provides cutting-edge, cross-channel customer support features including bots and various other self-service solutions.

This document guides you in setting up Freshdesk as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Freshdesk data, which can then be routed to your RudderStack-supported data warehouse destination.

### Destination settings

The following settings specify how RudderStack sends the data ingested from Freshdesk to the connected warehouse destination:

- **Table prefix**: RudderStack uses this prefix to create a table in your data warehouse and loads all your Freshdesk data into it.
- **Schedule Settings**: RudderStack gives you three options to ingest the data from Freshdesk:
    - **Basic**: Runs the syncs at the specified time interval. 
    - **CRON**: Runs the syncs based on the user-defined CRON expression.
    - **Manual**: You are required to run the syncs manually.

Freshdesk is now configured as a source. RudderStack will start ingesting data from Freshdesk as per your specified schedule and frequency.

You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Add Destination**, as shown:

### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

We have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
