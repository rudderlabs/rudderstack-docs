[Freshdesk](https://freshdesk.com/) is a popular customer support software. It provides cutting-edge, cross-channel customer support features including bots and various other self-service solutions. You can track and manage your customer support tickets, set deadlines for their response, and bring together all your customer communications via different channels into a single platform.

This document guides you in setting up Freshdesk as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Freshdesk data, which can then be routed to your data warehouse destination supported by RudderStack.

- Then, enter the required connection credentials to give RudderStack access to your Freshdesk account. The required settings are:
  - **Account Name**: Your Freshdesk account name goes here.
  - **Subdomain**: Enter your Freshdesk subdomain here.
  - **API Key**: Enter your Freshdesk API key in this field. You can get this key by logging into your Freshdesk account, clicking on your profile picture and navigating to Profile Settings. You can find the API key on the right sidebar.

If you've already configured Freshdesk as a source before, you can choose the account visible under the **Use existing credentials** tab.

### Setting the Table Prefix, Run Frequency and Data Update Schedule

- Next, you will be required to set the **Table Prefix**. RudderStack will create a table in your warehouse with this prefix name and load all your Freshdesk data into it.
- Also, set the **Run Frequency** to schedule the data import from your Freshdesk account to RudderStack. Optionally, you can also specify the time when you want this synchronization to start, by choosing the time under the **Sync Starting At** option.

### Selecting the Data to Import

- Finally, choose the Freshdesk data that you wish to ingest via RudderStack. You can either select all the data, or choose specific Freshdesk data attributes, as per your requirement.

That's it! Freshdesk is now successfully configured as a source on your RudderStack dashboard.

RudderStack will start ingesting data from Freshdesk as per the specified frequency. You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Connect Destinations** or **Add Destinations**, as shown:

<!--<img src="../../assets/8 (4).png" />-->

<div class="successBlock">

  Use the **Connect Destinations** option if you have already
  configured a data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data
  warehouse destination from scratch, click on the **Add Destination** button.

## FAQs

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

We have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.

#### Where do I find the Freshdesk API Key?

To get your Freshdesk API key, follow these steps:

- Log into your [Freshdesk account](https://freshdesk.com/login).
- Click on your profile picture and go to **Profile Settings**.
- You can find the Freshdesk API key on the right sidebar.
