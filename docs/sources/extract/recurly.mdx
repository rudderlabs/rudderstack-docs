[Recurly](https://recurly.com/) is an email delivery and marketing tool that lets you build and deliver personalized experiences through their API and marketing automation flows.

This document guides you in setting up Sendgrid as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Sendgrid data, which can then be routed to your RudderStack-supported data warehouse destination.

### Destination settings

The following settings specify how RudderStack sends the data ingested from Recurly to the connected warehouse destination:

- **Table prefix**: RudderStack uses this prefix to create a table in your data warehouse and loads all your Recurly data into it.
- **Schedule Settings**: RudderStack gives you three options to ingest the data from Recurly:
    - **Basic**: Runs the syncs at the specified time interval. 
    - **CRON**: Runs the syncs based on the user-defined CRON expression.
    - **Manual**: You are required to run the syncs manually.

### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
