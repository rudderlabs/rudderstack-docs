[Pipedrive](https://www.pipedrive.com/) is a popular sales CRM and pipeline management tool. It lets you manage your leads, track all your customer communications, and automate administrative tasks.

This document guides you in setting up Pipedrive as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your Pipedrive data and routes it to your specified data warehouse destination.

- **Start Date**: Select the date from when RudderStack ingests your Pipedrive data. RudderStack will **not replicate** any data before this date.
- **API Token**: Enter your Pipedrive API token. Refer to the [Pipedrive documentation](https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/how-to-find-the-api-token) for more information on obtaining the API token.

### Destination settings

The following settings specify how RudderStack sends the data ingested from Pipedrive to the connected warehouse destination:

- **Table prefix**: RudderStack uses this prefix to create a table in your data warehouse and loads all your Pipedrive data into it.
- **Schedule Settings**: RudderStack gives you three options to ingest the data from Pipedrive:
    - **Basic**: Runs the syncs at the specified time interval. 
    - **CRON**: Runs the syncs based on the user-defined CRON expression.
    - **Manual**: You are required to run the syncs manually.

### Selecting the data to import

You can choose the Pipedrive data you want to ingest by selecting the required resources:

## FAQ

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

RudderStack implements a feature wherein it associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
