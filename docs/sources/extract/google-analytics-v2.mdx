[Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/) is one of the popular analytics service that allows you to track and report your website traffic across a variety of sources.

This document guides you in setting up Google Analytics as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your Google Analytics data and routes it to your specified data warehouse destination.

## Getting started

To set up Google Analytics as a Cloud Extract source in RudderStack, follow these steps:

1. Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).
2. Go to **Sources** > **New source** > **Cloud Extract** and select **Google Analytics V2** from the list of sources.
3. Assign a name to your source and click **Continue**.

### Connection settings

Next, configure the following dashboard settings:

- **Credentials**: Choose from the two authentication types as explained below:

    - **Authenticate via Google (Oauth)**: Authenticate your Google Analytics account via Google (Oauth) by clicking
    **Sign in with Google** and granting the required permissions.

    - **Service Account Key Authentication**: Enter the service account key in JSON format in the **Service Account JSON Key field**. Refer to the [Google documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating_service_account_keys) for more information on obtaining the service account key.

<img src="../../assets/cloud-extract-sources/ga-oauth-settings-3.png" alt="Google Analytics credentials" />

- **Replication Start Date**: Choose the start date from which you want RudderStack to ingest the Google Analytics data. RudderStack will not replicate any data before this date.
- **View ID**: Enter the ID of the Google Analytics View you want to fetch the data from. Refer to this [documentation](https://docs.acquia.com/customer-data-platform/connectors/web-analytics-provider/google-analytics-profileid/) for more information on obtaining the View ID.
- **Custom Reports (Optional)**: Use this field to sync your [custom reports](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033013?hl=en) from Google Analytics. You can sync multiple reports.

  To add a custom report, click **Add Report** and enter the **Report Name**, **Metrics**, and **Dimensions** as shown:

  <img src="../../assets/cloud-extract-sources/ga-custom-report.png" alt="Google Analytics credentials" />

  You can also edit/delete an existing report, as shown:

  <br/>
  <img src="../../assets/cloud-extract-sources/delete-custom-report.png" alt="Google Analytics credentials" />

- **Data request time increment in days (Optional)**: Enter the number of days after which RudderStack should request data from the Google Analytics API. It is recommended to set this value to 1 to avoid getting the [sampled data](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2637192#zippy=%2Cin-this-article). The minimum and maximum allowed values for this field are 1 and 364 respectively.

### Destination settings

The following settings specify how RudderStack sends the data ingested from Google Analytics to the connected warehouse destination:

- **Table prefix**: RudderStack uses this prefix to create a table in your data warehouse and loads all your Google Analytics data into it.
- **Schedule Settings**: RudderStack gives you three options to ingest the data from Google Analytics:
    - **Basic**: Runs the syncs at the specified time interval. 
    - **CRON**: Runs the syncs based on the user-defined CRON expression.
    - **Manual**: You are required to run the syncs manually.

The below table mentions the syncs supported by these resources from Google Analytics to your warehouse destination:

| Resource | Full Refresh sync | Incremental sync | 
| :---| :---- | :---- | 
| `weekly_active_users`     |  Yes | Yes |
| `website_overview`|  Yes | Yes |
| `two_weekly_active_users`|  Yes | Yes |
| `traffic_sources`|  Yes | Yes |
| `pages`|  Yes | Yes |
| `monthly_active_users`|  Yes | Yes |
| `locations`|  Yes | Yes |
| `four_weekly_active_users`|  Yes | Yes |
| `devices`|  Yes | Yes |
| `daily_active_users`| Yes | Yes |

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on the <strong>Full Refresh</strong> and <strong>Incremental</strong> sync modes, refer to the <Link to="/sources/extract/common-settings/#sync-modes">Common Settings</Link> guide.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">
To sync the data in incremental mode, you must include the <code class="inline-code">ga:date</code> dimension in your report. Otherwise, RudderStack will sync the data in full refresh mode.
</div>

Google Analytics is now configured as a source. RudderStack will start ingesting data from Google Analytics as per your specified schedule and frequency.

You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Add Destination**, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/cloud-extract-sources/add-destination.png" alt="Adding a destination" />

<div class="successBlock">
Use the <strong>Use Existing Destination</strong> option if you have an already-configured data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data warehouse destination from scratch, select the <strong>Create New Destination</strong> button.

## FAQ

### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
