Zendesk Chat is a cross-platform live chat software that allows you to reach out to your customers in real-time via live chats and instant messaging. It also gives you the flexibility to have instant access to your ongoing as well as historical chats to get a full context of your conversations with your customers at all times. With Zendesk Chat, you can deliver rich, personalized user experiences across web and mobile. In addition, it is very easy to automate, and highly scalable for all your customer needs.

This document guides you in setting up Zendesk Chat as a Cloud Extract source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Zendesk Chat data, which can then be routed to your data warehouse destination supported by RudderStack.

That's it! Zendesk Chat is now successfully configured as a source on your RudderStack dashboard.

RudderStack will start ingesting data from your Zendesk Chat source as per the specified frequency. You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Connect Destinations** or **Add Destination**, as shown:

  warehouse destination from scratch, click on the
  **Add Destination** button.

## FAQs

#### How can I find my Zendesk Chat subdomain?

Your Zendesk Chat's subdomain can be easily identified from your account's URL. It is usually in the format of `https://[YOUR_ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN].zendesk.com`.

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

We have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
