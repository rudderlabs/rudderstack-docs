  Detailed technical documentation on ingesting your event data from your Cloud Extract sources into RudderStack.

With RudderStack Cloud Extract, you can collect your raw events and data from different cloud tools such as [Facebook Ads](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads), [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/), [Marketo](https://www.marketo.com/), [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/), [Stripe](stripe/), and more. You can then build efficient ELT pipelines from these cloud apps to your data warehouse.

<div class="warningBlock">
Cloud Extract sources support sending data only to a single <Link to="/destinations/warehouse-destinations/">data warehouse destination</Link>. To send data to multiple data warehouses from the same source, RudderStack recommends creating individual sources with the same settings for each warehouse destination.
