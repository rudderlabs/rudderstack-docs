This document guides you in setting up ActiveCampaign as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified ActiveCampaign data, which can then be routed to your RudderStack-supported data warehouse destination.

### Destination settings

The following settings specify how RudderStack sends the data ingested from ActiveCampaign to the connected warehouse destination:

- **Table prefix**: RudderStack uses this prefix to create a table in your data warehouse and loads all your ActiveCampaign data into it.
- **Schedule Settings**: RudderStack gives you three options to ingest the data from ActiveCampaign:
    - **Basic**: Runs the syncs at the specified time interval. 
    - **CRON**: Runs the syncs based on the user-defined CRON expression.
    - **Manual**: You are required to run the syncs manually.
