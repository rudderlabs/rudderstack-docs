[QuickBooks](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/in/) is a cloud-based accounting software that allows small to medium-sized enterprises to track and manage their accounting and sales data efficiently. With QuickBooks, you can create custom invoices and sales receipts, manage your cash flow and accounting reports, track your employees' billable hours, and do so much more.

This document guides you in setting up QuickBooks as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified QuickBooks accounting data, which can then be routed to your data warehouse destination supported by RudderStack.

### Setting the Table Prefix, Run Frequency and Data Update Schedule

- Next, you will be required to set the **Table Prefix**. RudderStack will create a table with this prefix name in your database and load all your QuickBooks data into it.
- Also, set the **Run Frequency** to schedule the data import from your QuickBooks account to RudderStack. Optionally, you can also specify the time when you want this synchronization to start, by choosing the time under the **Sync Starting At** option.

- Finally, choose the QuickBooks data that you wish to ingest via RudderStack. You can either select all the data, or choose specific QuickBooks attributes, as per your requirement.

That's it! QuickBooks is now successfully configured as a source on your RudderStack dashboard.

RudderStack will start ingesting data from QuickBooks source as per the specified frequency. You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Connect Destinations** or **Add Destination**, as shown:

  Use the **Connect Destinations** option if you have already
  configured a data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data
  warehouse destination from scratch, click the
  **Add Destination** button.

## FAQs

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

We have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
