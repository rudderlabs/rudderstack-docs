### Destination settings

The following settings specify how RudderStack sends the data ingested from Mixpanel to the connected warehouse destination:

- **Table prefix**: RudderStack uses this prefix to create a table in your data warehouse and loads all your Mixpanel data into it.
- **Schedule Settings**: RudderStack gives you three options to ingest the data from Mixpanel:
    - **Basic**: Runs the syncs at the specified time interval. 
    - **CRON**: Runs the syncs based on the user-defined CRON expression.
    - **Manual**: You are required to run the syncs manually.

## FAQ

### Can I connect my Mixpanel source to multiple data warehouse destinations?

You can connect <strong>only one data warehouse destination</strong> per Cloud Extract source. If you wish to send data to multiple warehouses, you can configure multiple Cloud Extract sources with the same settings and connect them to each data warehouse.

### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
