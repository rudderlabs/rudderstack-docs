[Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) is an industry-leading, real-time business messaging platform, that allows you to bring together and manage all your customer life cycle activities on a single platform.

This document guides you in setting up Intercom as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Intercom data, which can then be routed to your data warehouse destination supported by RudderStack.

## Getting Started

To set up Intercom as a source on the RudderStack dashboard, follow these steps:

- Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderlabs.com/signup?type=freetrial).
- From the left panel, select **Sources**. Then, click on **Add Source**, as shown:

  alt="Authenticate RudderStack with Intercom"
/>

If you've already configured Intercom as a source before, you can choose the account visible under the **Use existing credentials** tab.

### Setting the Data Update Schedule

- Next, you will be required to set the **Run Frequency** to schedule the data import from your Intercom account to RudderStack. You can also specify the time when you want this synchronization to start, by choosing the time under the **Sync Starting At** option.

### Selecting the Data to Import

- Finally, choose the Intercom data that you wish to ingest via RudderStack. You can either select all the data, or choose specific Intercom data attributes, as per your requirement.

That's it! Intercom is now successfully configured as a source on your RudderStack dashboard.

RudderStack will start ingesting data from Intercom as per the specified frequency. You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Connect Destinations** or **Add Destination**, as shown:

  Use the **Connect Destinations** option if you have already
  configured a data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data
  warehouse destination from scratch, click on the
  **Add Destination** button.

## FAQs

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

We have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
