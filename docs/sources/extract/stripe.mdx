[Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is an online payment processing system for businesses. It offers cutting-edge software and APIs that allows thousands of businesses to manage their payments online.

This document guides you in setting up Stripe as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Stripe data, which can then be routed to your RudderStack-supported data warehouse destination.

## Getting started

To set up Stripe as a source in RudderStack, follow these steps:

1. Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).
2. Go to **Sources** > **New source** > **Cloud Extract** and select **Stripe** from the list of sources.
3. Assign a name to your source and click **Next**.

### Connection settings

1. Click **Connect with Stripe** and give RudderStack the required access to your Stripe account.
2. **Stripe Version**: Under **Source Settings**, select the default API version associated with your Stripe account.

### Destination settings

The following settings specify how RudderStack sends the data ingested from Stripe to the connected warehouse destination:

- **Table prefix**: RudderStack uses this prefix to create a table in your data warehouse and loads your Stripe data into it.
- **Schedule Settings**: RudderStack gives you three options to ingest the data from Stripe:
    - **Basic**: Runs the syncs at the specified time interval. 
    - **CRON**: Runs the syncs based on the user-defined CRON expression.
    - **Manual**: You are required to run the syncs manually.

Stripe is now configured as a source. RudderStack will start ingesting data from Stripe as per your specified schedule and frequency.

You can connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking **Add Destination**, as shown:

<div class="successBlock">

Use the <strong>Use Existing Destination</strong> option if you have an already-configured data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data warehouse destination from scratch, select the <strong>Create New Destination</strong> button.

## FAQ

### How do I determine the API version associated with my Stripe account?

To determine your Stripe API version, go to **Developers** > **Overview**. Here, you should be able to see your Stripe API version, as shown:

### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
