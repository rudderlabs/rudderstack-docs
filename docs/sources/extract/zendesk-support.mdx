### Connection settings

To set up Zendesk Support as a Cloud Extract source, you need to configure the following settings:

- **Start Date**: Choose the start date from which you want RudderStack to ingest the Zendesk Support data. RudderStack will not replicate any data before this date.

<div class="warningBlock">
If you do not specify the start date, RudderStack will replicate all your data by default.
</div>

- **Subdomain**: Enter the subdomain from your Zendesk account's URL. For example, if your Zendesk account URL is `sample.zendesk.com`, the subdomain would be `sample`.
- **Authentication**: Select an authentication method from the dropdown:
    - **OAuth2.0**: Click **Connect with Zendesk Support** to authenticate your account.
    - **API token**: Enter the **Email** used to log in to the Zendesk account and the **API token**. Refer to the [Zendesk documentation](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408889192858-Generating-a-new-API-token) section for more details on obtaining the API Token. 


### Destination settings

The following settings specify how RudderStack sends the ingested data from Zendesk Support to the warehouse destination:

- **Table prefix**: RudderStack uses this prefix to create a table in your data warehouse and loads all your Zendesk Support data into it.
- **Schedule Settings**: RudderStack gives you three options to ingest the data from Zendesk Support:
    - **Basic**: Runs the syncs at the specified time interval. 
    - **CRON**: Runs the syncs based on the user-defined CRON expression.
    - **Manual**: You are required to run the syncs manually.

Zendesk Support is now configured as a source. RudderStack will start ingesting data from Zendesk Support as per your specified schedule and frequency.

You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Add Destination**, as shown:

<div class="successBlock">
Use the <strong>Use Existing Destination</strong> option if you have an already-configured data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data warehouse destination from scratch, select the <strong>Create New Destination</strong> button.

## FAQ

### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
