Zendesk Chat is a cross-platform live chat software. It lets you reach out to your customers in real-time via live chats and instant messaging.

This document guides you in setting up Zendesk Chat as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your Zendesk Chat data and routes it to your specified data warehouse destination.

## Getting started

To set up Zendesk Chat as a source in RudderStack, follow these steps:

1. Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).
2. Go to **Sources** > **New source** > **Cloud Extract** and select **Zendesk Chat** from the list of sources.
3. Assign a name to your source and click **Continue**.

### Connection settings

To set up Zendesk Chat as a Cloud Extract source, you need to configure the following settings:

<img src="../../assets/cloud-extract-sources/zendesk-chat-connection-settings.png" alt="Zendesk Chat connection settings" />

- **Start Date**: Choose the start date from which you want RudderStack to ingest the Zendesk Chat data. RudderStack will not replicate any data before this date.

<div class="warningBlock">
You will not be able to proceed if you do not specify the start date.
</div>

- **Subdomain**: Enter the subdomain from your Zendesk account's URL. For example, if your Zendesk account URL is `sample.zendesk.com`, the subdomain would be `sample`.

<div class="warningBlock">
It is <strong>mandatory</strong> to provide a subdomain if your Zendesk account URL is of the format <code class="inline-code">sample.zendesk.com</code>. However, if you only have a Zendesk Chat account and the URL does not follow this format, you can skip this field and set up your source without specifying a subdomain.
</div>

- **Authentication**: Select an authentication method from the dropdown:
    - **OAuth2.0**: Click **Connect with Zendesk Chat** to authenticate your account.
    - **Access token**: Enter your Zendesk Chat access token. Refer to the [Zendesk Chat documentation](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408882184986-Getting-an-OAuth-access-token-for-testing-purposes) for more details on obtaining this token.

### Destination settings

The following settings specify how RudderStack sends the ingested data from Zendesk Chat to the warehouse destination:

- **Table prefix**: RudderStack uses this prefix to create a table in your data warehouse and loads all your Zendesk Chat data into it.
- **Schedule Settings**: RudderStack gives you three options to ingest the data from Zendesk Chat:
    - **Basic**: Runs the syncs at the specified time interval. 
    - **CRON**: Runs the syncs based on the user-defined CRON expression.
    - **Manual**: You are required to run the syncs manually.

</div>

You can choose the Zendesk Chat data you want to ingest by selecting the required resources:

Zendesk Chat is now configured as a source. RudderStack will start ingesting data from Zendesk Chat as per your specified schedule and frequency.

You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Add Destination**, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/cloud-extract-sources/add-destination.png" alt="Adding a destination" />

<div class="successBlock">
Use the <strong>Use Existing Destination</strong> option if you have an already-configured data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data warehouse destination from scratch, select the <strong>Create New Destination</strong> button.

## FAQ

### Where can I find my Zendesk Chat subdomain?

You can easily identify the Zendesk Chat subdomain from your account URL. It is in the format `https://[YOUR_ZENDESK_SUBDOMAIN].zendesk.com`.

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

We have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
