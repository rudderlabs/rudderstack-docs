[Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) is a popular email marketing automation platform used worldwide by thousands of businesses. Built specially for eCommerce and retail, Mailchimp allows you to build your audience and send them personalized campaign and marketing messages through web or mobile.

This document guides you in setting up Mailchimp as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Mailchimp data, which can then be routed to your data warehouse destination supported by RudderStack.

### Configuring the Mailchimp Source

- Select the **Earliest campaign year** and the **Campaign fetch period** in the settings. The details are as follows:
  - **Earliest campaign year**: The first import will fetch all the campaign data since the start of the specified year.
  - **Campaign fetch period**: All the subsequent imports will fetch the campaign data up to this specified period.

### Setting the Table Prefix, Run Frequency and Data Update Schedule

- Next, you will be required to set the **Table Prefix**. RudderStack will create a table with this prefix name in your database and load all your Mailchimp data into it.
- Also, set the **Run Frequency** to schedule the data import from your Mailchimp account to RudderStack. Optionally, you can also specify the time when you want this synchronization to start, by choosing the time under the **Sync Starting At** option.

That's it! Mailchimp is now successfully configured as a source on your RudderStack dashboard.

RudderStack will start ingesting data from Mailchimp as per the specified frequency. You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Connect Destinations** or **Add Destinations**, as shown:

## FAQs

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

We have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
