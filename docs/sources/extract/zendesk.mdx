- **Schedule Settings**: RudderStack gives you three options to ingest the data from Zendesk:
    - **Basic**: Runs the syncs at the specified time interval. 
    - **CRON**: Runs the syncs based on the user-defined CRON expression.
    - **Manual**: You are required to run the syncs manually.

### Can I connect my Zendesk source to multiple data warehouse destinations?

You can connect your Zendesk source to **only one** data warehouse destination. If you wish to send data to multiple warehouses, you can configure multiple Zendesk sources with the same settings and connect them to each data warehouse.

### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
