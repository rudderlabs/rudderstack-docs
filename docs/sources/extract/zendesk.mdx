[Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) is a popular customer support, sales and service platform that lets you serve and engage with your customers effectively. Zendesk offers integrated customer support, a modern sales CRM, as well as a smart, self-serve knowledge base. In addition, its analytics and reporting capabilities lets you understand your customers better. In addition, you can also engage with them more effectively through Zendesk's personalized live chats and messaging service.

This document guides you in setting up Zendesk as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Zendesk data, which can then be routed to your data warehouse destination supported by RudderStack.

For the **Subdomain** input, do not include `.zendesk.com` as part of the subdomain. Just include the subdomain name.

To create a Zendesk API token, log into your Zendesk dashboard, and navigate to **Admin** - **Channels** - **API** in the Zendesk admin interface, and click the **Add New Token** link.

### Setting the Data Update Schedule

- Next, you will be required to set the **Run Frequency** to schedule the data import from your Zendesk account to RudderStack. You can also specify the time when you want this synchronization to start, by choosing the time under the **Sync Starting At** option.

That's it! Zendesk is now successfully configured as a source on your RudderStack dashboard.

RudderStack will start ingesting data from your Zendesk source as per the specified frequency. You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Connect Destinations** or **Add Destination**, as shown:

  Use the **Connect Destinations** option if you have already
  configured a data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data
  warehouse destination from scratch, click on the
  **Add Destination** button.

## FAQs

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

We have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
