[SIGNL4](https://www.signl4.com/) is a tool for instant mobile alerting which generates real-time alerts to inform teams about any incidents. It automatically delivers critical information to the right people at the right time.

## Getting started

Follow these steps to set up your SIGNL4 source in the RudderStack dashboard:

1. Go to your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/) and click **Add Source**. From the list of **Event Streams** sources, select **SIGNL4**.
2. Assign a name to your source and click **Continue**.
3. Your SIGNL4 source is now configured. Note the **Webhook URL** in the **Settings** tab, as shown:

4. Log into your <a href="https://connect.signl4.com/">SIGNL4 account</a>. 
5. Go to **Teams** > **Developer** and enter a name and the **Webhook URL** under **Outbound Webhooks** section, as shown:

6. Finally, click **Add**. 

## Event transformation

SIGNL4 acts as a webhook source and ingests all the events mentioned in [SIGNL4 documentation](https://www.signl4.com/outbound-webhooks/#N10).

Each event has a unique code present in the <code class="inline-code">eventType</code> property. The event name is mapped on the basis of this code as explained below:

| `eventType` code  | Event name | SIGNL4 action |
| :------------------ | :------------- |:------------- |
| 200  | New Alert Created    | New alert created in SIGNL4. |
| 201 | Alert Confirmed/Alert Resolved    | Alert confirmed by the user. Alert resolved if the statusCode is 4. |
| 202  | Alert Escalated    | Alert escalated when not confirmed in specified time. |
| 203  | Alert Annotated   | Message/Annotation sent by the receiver for an alert. |
| 300  | Duty Period Started    | Duty period started for a team. |
| 301  | Duty Period Ended    | Duty period ended for a team. |
| 302  | Somebody Punched-In    | When a team member comes on duty. |
| 303  | Somebody Punched-Out   | When a team member goes off duty. |
| Any other  | Alert Updated    | Default. |

RudderStack ingests the SIGNL4 events after converting them into the RudderStack event format. It also maps the following properties from the SIGNL4 event payload to the RudderStack properties:

| SIGNL4 property  | RudderStack property| 
| :------------------ | :------------- |
| `eventType`  | `event`    | 
| `eventRaisedUtc`        | `originalTimestamp`        | 
| `user.id` | `context.externalId`        | 
| `id`        | `messageId`|
| `team.id`     | `properties.team.id`   | 
| `annotation.message`    | `properties.annotation.message`  |
| `annotation.id`     | `properties.annotation.id`   |
| `alert.eventId`  | `properties.alert.eventId`    | 
| `alert.id`        | `properties.alert.id`        | 
| `alert.externalEventId` | `properties.alert.externalEventId`        | 
| `alert.statusCode`        | `properties.alert.statusCode`|
| `user.username`     | `context.traits.name`   | 
| `user.mailaddress`    | `context.traits.email`  |
| `subscription.id`     | `properties.subscription.id`   |
| `alert.acknowledgedUserIds`     | `properties.alert.acknowledgedUserIds`   |

## How RudderStack creates the event payload

This section details how RudderStack receives the data from SIGNL4 source and creates the resulting payload.

A sample payload sent by SIGNL4 is shown below:

```json
{
  "eventType": 203,
  "eventRaisedUtc": "2018-04-17T15:00:32Z",
  "subscription": {
    "id": "1578ebd9-0a27-44ab-bc8e-52cd7d32e81d"
  },
  "user": {
    "username": "Alex",
    "mailaddress": "alex@signl4.com",
    "id": "f0bd5063-9588-51cf-b3d9-94e5647dedc5"
  },
  "alert": {
    "statusCode": 0,
    "eventId": "2518783235949759942_fbc7b4a4-badd-47b8-9e1d-702fb6a1a0b2",
    "externalEventId": "INC091210",
    "id": "2518783235958846071_4e2dfab2-4717-42bc-8d37-8682402309c2"
  },
  "annotation": {
    "message": "OK, I'll take care about it.",
    "id": "2518783235661483318_99ebffe0-1b90-40ef-990a-fbd842484761"
  },
  "id": "141c0f88-7831-4d5e-b055-f6e83c269770"
}
```

RudderStack transforms the above payload into the following payload:

```json
{
  "type": "track",
  "event": "Alert Annotated",
  "context": {
    "library": {
      "name": "unknown",
      "version": "unknown"
    },
    "traits": {
      "name": "Alex",
      "email": "alex@signl4.com"
    },
    "externalId": [{
      "type": "signl4UserId",
      "id": "f0bd5063-9588-51cf-b3d9-94e5647dedc5",
    }],
    "integration": {
      "name": "SIGNL4"
    }
  },
  "messageId": "141c0f88-7831-4d5e-b055-f6e83c269770",
  "originalTimestamp": "2017-09-01T08:11:37.000Z",
  "properties": {
    "alert.statusCode": 0,
    "alert.eventId": "2518783235949759942_fbc7b4a4-badd-47b8-9e1d-702fb6a1a0b2",
    "alert.externalEventId": "INC091210",
    "alert.id": "2518783235958846071_4e2dfab2-4717-42bc-8d37-8682402309c2",
    "subscription.id": "183f8d00-3bb8-4636-9a8f-89d6af26374a",
    "annotation.id": "2518783235661483318_99ebffe0-1b90-40ef-990a-fbd842484761",
    "message": "OK, I'll take care of it."
  },
  "anonymousId": "6f0a3dc76a335860e17fa1d8ab779742e2ca",
  "integrations": {
    "SIGNL4": false
  }
}
```
