[Braze](https://www.braze.com/) is a customer engagement platform that helps you better understand your customers' in-app behavior and use the insights to improve your users' app experience.

You can send your Braze events to RudderStack by leveraging [Braze Currents](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/).

This guide will help you set up Braze as a source in RudderStack.

## Getting started

Follow these steps to set up your Braze source in the RudderStack dashboard:

1. Go to your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/) and click on **Add Source**. From the list of **Event Streams** sources, select **Braze**.
2. Assign a name to your source and click **Continue**.
3. Your Braze is now configured. Note the source **Write key** required to configure the webhook URL.
