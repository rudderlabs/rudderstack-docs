[monday.com](https://monday.com/) is a popular workflow management tool. It lets you create efficient cross-team workflows and automations for better collaboration and maximum productivity.

This guide will help you set up monday.com as a source in RudderStack.

## Getting started

Follow these steps to set up your monday.com source in the RudderStack dashboard:

1. Go to your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/) and click **Add Source**. From the list of **Event Streams** sources, select **Monday**.
2. Assign a name to your source and click **Continue**.
3. Your monday.com source is now configured. Note the **Webhook URL** in the **Settings** tab, as shown:

4. Next, create a new webhook in your [monday.com dashboard](https://auth.monday.com/auth/login_monday) by clicking the **Integrate** button and searching for the **Webhooks** app in the the **Integrations Center**.
5. Choose the relevant monday.com actions to get the instant event payloads.
6. Finally, specify the webhook URL obtained in Step 3. All the event payloads will be sent to this URL.

## Event transformation

RudderStack ingests the monday.com events after converting them into the RudderStack event format. It also maps the following properties from the monday.com event payload to the RudderStack properties:

| monday.com property  | RudderStack property |
| :------------------ | :------------- |
| `userId` | `userId` |
| `triggerTime` | `originalTimestamp` |
| `boardId` | `properties.boardId` |
| `pulseId` | `properties.pulseId` |
| `pulseName` | `properties.pulseName` |
| `groupId` | `properties.groupId` |
| `groupName` | `properties.groupName` |
| `groupColor` | `properties.groupColor` |
| `isTopGroup` | `properties.isTopGroup` |
| `columnValues` | `properties.columnValues` |
| `app` | `properties.app` |
| `type` | `properties.type` | 
| `subscriptionId` | `properties.subscriptionId` |
| `triggerUuid` | `properties.triggerUuid` |
| `parentItemId` | `properties.parentItemId` |
| `parentItemBoardId` | `properties.parentItemBoardId` |
| `itemId` | `properties.itemId` |
| `previousValue` | `properties.previousValue` |
| `value` | `properties.value` |

- A subitem is deleted.
- A new update is posted on a subitem.
- A subitem column is changed.

## How RudderStack creates the event payload

This section details how RudderStack receives the data from monday.com source and creates the resulting payload.

A sample payload sent by monday.com when an item is deleted, is shown below:

```json
{
  event: {
    userId: 33556506,
    originalTriggerUuid: null,
    boardId: 3139815405,
    itemId: 3160188786,
    itemName: "New Sprint Item",
    app: "monday",
    type: "delete_pulse",
    triggerTime: "2022-08-30T09:06:09.176Z",
    subscriptionId: 150882006,
    triggerUuid: "4e4f87c8255c4ba4ba2f5e9934cb6d40",
  },
}
```

RudderStack transforms the above payload into the following payload:

```json
{
  "type": "track",
  "event": "Delete Pulse",
  "context": {
    "library": {
      "name": "unknown",
      "version": "unknown"
    },
    "externalId": [{
      "id": 33556506,
      "type": "mondayUserId"
    }],
    "integration": {
      "name": "MONDAY"
    }
  },
  "rudderId": "a2073e09-4646-437c-b197-7d2517d202ce",
  "messageId": "4e4f0cfa-c7e2-444f-af70-b90292c3775a",
  "timestamp": "2022-08-30T09:06:09.176Z",
  "properties": {
    "app": "monday",
    "type": "delete_pulse",
    "itemId": 3160188786,
    "boardId": 3139815405,
    "itemName": "New Sprint Item",
    "triggerUuid": "4e4f87c8255c4ba4ba2f5e9934cb6d40",
    "subscriptionId": 150882006,
    "originalTriggerUuid": null
  },
  "anonymousId": "6f0a3dc76a335860e17fa1d8ab779742e2ca",
  "integrations": {
    "MONDAY": false
  },
  "originalTimestamp": "2022-08-30T09:06:09.176Z"
}
```
