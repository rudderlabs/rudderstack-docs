[Customer.io](https://customer.io/) is a popular marketing platform for sending targeted emails and push and SMS notifications to improve customer engagement and thereby the overall conversion rate.

You can send your Customer.io events by adding a webhook that points to RudderStack. These events include email-related actions such as email delivered, opened, bounced, and more.

This guide will help you set up Customer.io as a source in RudderStack.

## Getting started

Follow these steps to set up your Customer.io source in the RudderStack dashboard:

1. Go to your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/) and click on **Add Source**. From the list of **Event Streams** sources, select **Customer.io**.
2. Assign a name to your source and click **Continue**.

<div class="warningBlock">
To connect this source to a RudderStack warehouse destination, the source name should match the name of your warehouse schema.
</div>

3. Your Customer.io source is now configured. Go to the **Settings** tab and note the **Webhook URL**.

4. Go to your Customer.io dashboard. From the sidebar, go to the **Integrations** page and look for **Reporting Webhooks**, as shown:

<img src="../../../assets/event-stream-sources/customerio-3.png" alt="Customer.io reporting webhooks" />

5. Click on **Add Webhook** and add the webhook URL obtained in **Step 3**. The URL should be of the following format:

```
<DATA_PLANE_URL>/v1/webhook?writeKey=<WRITE_KEY>
```

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on the data plane URL, refer to the <Link to="/resources/glossary/#data-plane-url">Glossary</Link>.
</div>

6. Finally, save the webhook.
