[Auth0](https://auth0.com/) is a popular solution used by many companies to add authentication and authorization services to their applications. You can send your Auth0 authentication and user behavior-related events by adding a custom webhook that points to RudderStack.

## Getting started

Follow these steps to set up your Auth0 source in the RudderStack dashboard:

1. Go to your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/) and click **Add Source**. From the list of **Event Streams** sources, select **Auth0**.
2. Assign a name to your source and click **Continue**.
3. Your Auth0 source is now configured. Note the **Webhook URL** in the **Settings** tab, as shown:

4. Next, log into your [Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/).
5. Go to **Monitoring** > **Streams** > **Create Log Stream** > **Custom Webhook**, as shown:

<img src="../../../assets/event-stream-sources/auth0-dashboard-custom-webhook.png" alt="Auth0 source webhook URL" />

6. Name your custom webhook. In the **Payload URL** field, enter the webhook URL obtained in Step 3.

7. Configure the other webhook settings as required.

You can also filter the events sent to your custom webhook by category. For more information on these categories, refer to the <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/customize/log-streams/event-filters">Auth0 documentation</a>.

8. Click **Save** to save the custom webhook.

## Event transformation

RudderStack ingests the Auth0 events as <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify">`identify`</Link>, <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track">`track`</Link>, and <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/group">`group`</Link> calls.

- RudderStack converts the Auth0 payload into an `identify` event if the Auth0 payload contains the event `type` as `ss`. A sample Auth0 payload is as shown:

```json
{
  "log_id": "90020221031055712103169676686005480714681762668315934738",
  "data": {
    "date": "2022-10-31T05:57:06.859Z",
    "type": "ss",
    "description": "",
    "connection": "Username-Password-Authentication",
    "connection_id": "con_djwCjiwyID0vZy1S",
    "client_id": "vQcJNDTxsM1W72eHFonRJdzyOvawlwIt",
    "client_name": "All Applications",
    "ip": "35.166.202.113",
    "user_agent": "unknown",
    "user_id": "auth0|*****",
    "user_name": "testrudderstack@gmail.com",
    "strategy": "auth0",
    "strategy_type": "database",
    "log_id": "90020221031055712103169676686005480714681762668315934738"
  }
}
```

- RudderStack converts the Auth0 payload into an `group` event if the Auth0 payload contains the `description` as `Add members to an organization`. A sample Auth0 payload is as shown:

```json
{
  "log_id": "90020221031061004280169676882609459981150114445973782546",
  "data": {
    "date": "2022-10-31T06:09:59.135Z",
    "type": "sapi",
    "description": "Add members to an organization",
    "client_id": "vQcJNDTxsM1W72eHFonRJdzyOvawlwIt",
    "client_name": "",
    "ip": "35.167.74.121",
    "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/105.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
    "user_id": "google-oauth2|123456",
    "log_id": "90020221031061004280169676882609459981150114445973782546"
  }
}
```

- RudderStack converts the rest of the events as `track` events. A sample Auth0 payload is as shown:

```json
{
  "log_id": "90020221031061530247169676961198100736838335677367058450",
  "data": {
    "date": "2022-10-31T06:15:25.196Z",
    "type": "gd_tenant_update",
    "description": "Guardian - Updates tenant settings",
    "ip": "35.160.3.103",
    "user_id": "google-oauth2|123456",
    "log_id": "90020221031061530247169676961198100736838335677367058450"
  }
}
```

RudderStack maps the following properties from Auth0 event payload to the RudderStack properties for all the `identify`, `track`, and `group` events:

| **Auth0 Property**        | **RudderStack Property**                  |
| :------------------------ | :--------------------------------- |
| `auth0_client`      | `properties.auth0_client`   |
| `client_id`      | `properties.client_id`       |
| `client_name`       | `properties.client_name`    |
| `connection` | `traits.connection` |
| `connection_id` | `traits.connection_id` |
| `description`    | `properties.description`        |
| `details`       | `properties.details` |
| `details.auth.user.email` | `context.traits.email`    |
| `details.auth.user.name`  | `context.traits.name`      |
| `log_id`      | `properties.log_id`     |
| `isMobile`    | `properties.is_mobile`       |
| `ip`         | `context.request_ip`          |
| `user_name`      | `context.traits.user_name`  |
| `user_agent`     | `context.userAgent`  |
| `user_id` | `userId` <br/> `context.traits.userId` |

## Debugging

If you are unable to see any events flowing from the Auth0 API webhooks to RudderStack, you can troubleshoot the issue by viewing the API webhooks logs. To do so, go to your Auth0 dashboard and navigate to **Monitoring** > **Logs**.
