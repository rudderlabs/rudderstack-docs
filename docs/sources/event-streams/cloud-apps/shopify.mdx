description: Step-by-step guide to ingest your event data from Shopify into RudderStack.
---

[Shopify](https://www.shopify.in/) is a popular e-commerce platform that gives you all the tools to start, run, and grow your business effectively. It offers online retailers a variety of services around digital payments, marketing, product shipping, customer engagement and retention, and more.

This guide will help you set up Shopify as a source in RudderStack.

<div class="infoBlock">
Setting up the Shopify source involves two steps:
<ul>
  <li><a href="#configuring-the-shopify-source-in-rudderstack">Configuring the Shopify source in RudderStack</a></li>
  <li><a href="#configuring-the-rudderstack-app-in-your-shopify-store">Configuring the RudderStack app in your Shopify store</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

## Configuring the Shopify source in RudderStack

Follow these steps to set up your Shopify source in the RudderStack dashboard:

1. Go to your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/) and click on **Add Source**. From the list of **Event Streams** sources, select **Shopify**.
2. Assign a name to your source and click **Continue**.
3. Your Shopify source is now configured. Note the source **Write key**. This will be required later while configuring the RudderStack app on your Shopify store.

4. Finally, connect the source to your desired destinations.

## Configuring the RudderStack app in your Shopify store

To complete the configuration, you need to add and configure the RudderStack app in your Shopify store. Follow these steps:

1. Go to your Shopify store's [admin dashboard](https://accounts.shopify.com/store-login).
2. In the left sidebar, go to **Apps** > **Customize your store**, as shown:

<img src="../../../assets/event-stream-sources/shopify-3.png" alt="Customizing Shopify store" />

3. Then, search for RudderStack.

<img src="../../../assets/event-stream-sources/shopify-4.png" alt="RudderStack app search" />

4. In the search results, select the RudderStack app and click **Add app**. 

<img src="../../../assets/event-stream-sources/RS-Shopify-app.png" alt="Add RudderStack app" />

<div class="successBlock">
Alternatively, you can install the RudderStack app directly using this <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/rudderstack">link</a>.
</div>

5. After installation, you should be able to see the app in the **Installed apps** section, as shown:

<img src="../../../assets/event-stream-sources/shopify-5.png" alt="Installed RudderStack app" />

6. Select the installed RudderStack app.
7. Enter the **Source Write Key** that you copied <Link to="#configuring-the-shopify-source-in-rudderstack">above</Link> and the **RudderStack Data Plane URL**, as shown:

<img src="../../../assets/event-stream-sources/shopify-6.png" alt="Data plane URL and source write key" />

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on the obtaining the data plane URL, refer to the <Link to="/resources/glossary/#data-plane-url">Glossary</Link>.
</div>

8. Finally, click **Submit**.

<div class="successBlock">
You can also update these fields later with a different write key and data plane URL.
</div>

## Event transformation

The Shopify source supports both the server and client-side tracking. RudderStack enables simultaneous tracking of user events using these.

### Tracking server-side events

<div class="infoBlock">
RudderStack uses the Shopify-provided webhooks for tracking events on the server-side. 
</div>

The following table details the supported Shopify events and their corresponding [topic](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/2022-01/resources/webhook#:~:text=a%20custom%20storefront.-,Mandatory%20webhooks,-You%20don%27t%20create) mapping for `identify` calls:

| Identify event name            | Description                 | Subscribed Shopify topic      | 
| :-----------------------------| :---------------------------| :------------------------------|
| `customers_create`            | Customer was created.        | `customers/create`            | 
| `customers_update`            | Customer was updated.        | `customers/update`            |

RudderStack also supports the following [E-commerce events](https://rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/):

| E-commerce event name          | Description                 | Subscribed Shopify topic      |
| :----------------------------- | :---------------------------| :-----------------------------|
| `Checkout Started`             | A new checkout was created. | `checkouts/create`            |
| `Order Updated`                | Order was updated.          | `orders/updated`              |

<div class="warningBlock">
Any other events flowing through RudderStack except the <code class="inline-code">track</code>, <code class="inline-code">identify</code>, and the e-commerce events mentioned above will be <strong>discarded</strong>.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">
The user-related information is mapped into the <code class="inline-code">traits</code> object in the RudderStack payload. The product-specific information present in the above resources in <code class="inline-code">line_items</code> is mapped to the <code class="inline-code">products</code> array in the payload.

### Tracking client-side events

<div class="infoBlock">
For tracking the client-side events, RudderStack inserts a JavaScript tracking code into every page of the respective Shopify store.
</div>

- RudderStack supports the [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/page/) event for every page visited on the Shopify store.
- It also supports the `Registration Viewed` as a generic [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/standard-events/track/) event whenever the user views their account or registration page.
- The following [E-commerce events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/event-spec/ecommerce-events-spec/) are also supported on client-side:

| Event name             | Description                                |
| :----------------------| :------------------------------------------|
| `Cart Viewed`          | User viewed the cart page.                 |
| `Checkout Started`     | User clicked on the buy button.            |
| `Product Added`        | User added the product to the cart.        |
| `Product Clicked`      | User clicked on a product.                 |
| `Product List Viewed`  | User viewed the product collections page.  |
| `Product Viewed`       | User viewed a product page.                |

The below is an example of client-side event transformed by RudderStack:

```

## Best practices

### Provide login functionality

Shopify provides the store owners the capability to either make user login compulsory or allow guest checkout in their stores. However, it is a best practice to prompt users to log in onto your platform. That way, RudderStack can fetch the user details and provide you with meaningful event data corresponding to the user's journey on your platform.

### Support for client-side calls

It is highly recommended **not** to make any drastic changes to your store structure to preserve data integrity. If you do so, RudderStack may track incorrect calls or miss them entirely, owing to the disparity between URL and triggered event. 

Note the following additional details for e-commerce events tracked by RudderStack:

- **Cart Viewed**: It is recommended to keep the URL in `[store-url]/cart` format.
- **Checkout Started**: This event can be triggered in any of the following ways:
  - When **Checkout** button is clicked on the `[store-url]/cart` page.
  - When **Buy it Now** button is clicked on the product description page. 
  - Using the pop-ups when adding a product.
- **Product Added**: This event is triggered when the **Add to Cart** button is clicked on a product description page with `[store-url]/products/product_name` format.
- **Product Clicked**: This event is triggered when you click on a product entry on any page in the store.
- **Product List Viewed**: This event is triggered when the store’s catalog or collections page is viewed and all the products are listed in `[store-url]/collections/all` format.
- **Product Viewed**: This event is triggered when a product’s description page in `[store-url]/products/product_name` format is opened. It is an indicative of the product listing page being viewed.

## FAQ

### I'm getting a Registration Failed/Updated Failed error when I enter the data plane URL and the write key. What should I do?

When [configuring the RudderStack app in your Shopify store](#configuring-the-rudderstack-app-in-your-shopify-store), you need to enter your RudderStack data plane URL and the source write key obtained while [setting up the Shopify source in RudderStack](#configuring-the-shopify-source-in-rudderstack).

<img src="../../../assets/event-stream-sources/shopify-6.png" alt="Data plane URL and source write key" />

If you get a **Registrated Failed** or **Update Failed** error after entering the credentials, uninstall and reinstall the RudderStack app in your Shopify store and try again.

### Where can I find the RudderStack data plane URL?

You can find the data plane URL in the home page of your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com), as shown:

<img src="../../../assets/event-stream-sources/shopify-data-plane-url.png" alt="RudderStack data plane URL" />

### My app is behaving unexpectedly and no event is flowing. What should I do?

You can try deleting and reinstalling the app. If that does not work, you can [contact us](mailto:%20docs@rudderstack.com).

### How to track events from multiple stores?

You need to have the app installed and configured properly in each of the stores.

### What is the difference between `browser_ip` and `requestIP`?

The `requestIP` is the IP address of the Shopify backend server which pushes data to RudderStack, while `browser_ip` is the user's IP address.

### Is it possible to collect additional/custom fields from Shopify?

Yes, it is possible to collect additional/custom fields from Shopify by using `identify` and `track` calls.

Note that the `rudderanalytics` object of JS SDK (for example, `rudderanalytics.track()` or `rudderanalytics.identify()`) is already loaded on the `window` object of the store where the app is installed. Hence, the `rudderanalytics` object should not be loaded separately to collect additional/custom fields from Shopify.

### How does RudderStack set the `anonymousId`? Does RudderStack persist it for future calls?

RudderStack fetches Shopify's `customerId` and uses it as `anonymousId` to allow identity stitching in the downstream destinations.

No, RudderStack does not persist the `anonymousId` - it keeps on changing as the Shopify servers push data to RudderStack over the server-to-server APIs.

### How can I differentiate between the data collected from Shopify Cloud (Webhooks) and Shopify Device (web device mode)?

You can differentiate between the data collected in cloud and device mode by looking at the signature in payload:

- In the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode">cloud mode</Link>, RudderStack subscribes to the Shopify webhooks to consume data from Shopify. The data collected from Shopify cloud has the following signature in the payload:

```javascript
context ": {....
"library": {
  "name": "RudderStack Shopify Cloud",
  "version": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```
- In <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">device mode</Link>, RudderStack loads its JavaScript SDK on every Shopify store page for web tracking. The data collected from the Shopify device mode has the following signature in the payload:

```javascript
"context": {
  ....
  "library": {
    "name": "RudderLabs JavaScript SDK",
    "version": "2.4.2"
  }
}
```
