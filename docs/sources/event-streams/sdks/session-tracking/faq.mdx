---

## Generic

### Do the RudderStack server-side SDKs support the automatic session tracking feature?

No, the server-side SDKs do not support automatic session tracking. However, you can create your own session start and end events as backend events using the SDKs.

### How does RudderStack determine the `sessionId`?

RudderStack passes the event's `timestamp` (in milliseconds) as the `sessionId`. 

### Does RudderStack attach any user information to the `sessionId`?

RudderStack **does not** attach any user information to the `sessionId`. This is so that a user cannot be traced back or identified only with the `sessionId`.

### What happens if automatic session tracking is enabled but I call the `startSession()` API?

If you call the `startSession()` API while automatic session tracking is enabled, RudderStack ends the existing session and starts a new session. Also, it disables automatic session tracking.

### What happens to the existing session if I call the `reset()` API?

If you call the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/">`reset()`API</Link>, RudderStack ends the existing session and generates a new one.

### Which events and APIs does RudderStack support for session tracking?

RudderStack currently supports session tracking only for the following events:

- <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify/">Identify</Link>
- <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track/">Track</Link>
- <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/page/">Page</Link>
- <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/group/">Group</Link>
- <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/screen/">Screen</Link>
- <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/alias/">Alias</Link>

### Is automatic session tracking permanently disabled if I trigger manual session tracking?

If you manually trigger a session using the `startSession()` API, RudderStack will disable automatic session tracking only till the app is closed.

### What happens if I manually trigger a new session during an active session?

RudderStack will end the active session and generate a new session.

## JavaScript SDK

### What happens if I set `timeout` to 0 or less than 10 ms?

If you set the session's `timeout` to 0, RudderStack disables automatic session tracking. This is because upon setting the `timeout` to 0, RudderStack creates a new session for each event. As such, enabling automatic session tracking serves no purpose.

If your session `timeout` is less than 10 ms, RudderStack gives a caution but proceeds with the session tracking.

### Which session tracking-related information does RudderStack store?

RudderStack persists the following session tracking-related information in local storage/cookie in a new field called `rl_session`.

| Parameter | Data type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :-----|
| `sessionId` | String | Uniquely identifies a session. |
| Session expiration time | Number | Time when the session expires. RudderStack calculates it as the last event's `timestamp` + `timeout`. |
| Manual session tracking status | Boolean | - |
| Automatic session tracking status | Boolean | - |
| Session started | Boolean | A flag that identifies the first event of the session. |

### What happens I close a website tab and reopen it after some time?

If the time between closing the tab and reopening it is less than the session timeout (default is 30 minutes), then RudderStack continues the same session. Otherwise, it starts a new session.

## Mobile SDKs

### What is the scope of persistence in case of automatic session tracking? 

When an application is closed completely and launched from scratch, RudderStack checks if the inactivity timeout of the previous automatically tracked session has elapsed. If yes, RudderStack creates a new session, otherwise it continues the previous session.

### What is the scope of persistence in case of manual session tracking?

The scope of manual session tracking depends on whether the automatic session tracking feature is enabled.

- If automatic session tracking is **enabled**: On the next app launch (from scratch), RudderStack clears the manual session even if <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/session-tracking/manual-session-tracking/">`endSession()`</Link> is not called and generates a new **automatic** session.
- If automatic session tracking is **disabled**: On the next app launch, the manual session will still be active and cleared only when the user ends the session using `endSession()`.

### Where does RudderStack store the `sessionId`, last event time, and automatic session tracking status?

RudderStack stores the `sessionId`, the last event timestamp (used to determine <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/session-tracking/#session-expiration-in-mobile-sdks">session expiration</Link>), and the status of automatic session tracking in the following locations:

| Platform | Class |

| iOS | [`UserDefaults`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults) |
