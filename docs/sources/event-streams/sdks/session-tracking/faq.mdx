## General

## JavaScript SDK

### What is a session timeout?



### Which session tracking-related information does RudderStack store?

RudderStack persists the following session tracking-related information in local storage/cookie in a new field called `rl_session`.

| Parameter | Data type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :-----|
| `sessionId` | String | Uniquely identifies a session. |
| Session expiration time | Number | Time when the session expires. RudderStack calculates it as the last event's `timestamp` + `timeout`. |
| Manual session tracking status | Boolean | - |
| Automatic session tracking status | Boolean | - |
| Session started | Boolean | A flag that identifies the first event of the session. |

### What happens if a user closes a website tab and reopens it after some time?

If the time between closing the tab and reopening it is less than the session timeout (default is 30 minutes), then RudderStack continues the same session. Otherwise, it starts a new session.

### What happens if a user sets the session timeout to 0?

If a user sets the session timeout to 0, RudderStack disables automatic session tracking.
