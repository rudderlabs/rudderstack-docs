title: "Session Tracking"
description: Detailed technical description of RudderStack's session tracking feature.
aliases: ["session tracking", "user session"]
---

A session is a group of user interactions with your website or mobile app within a given time frame. It is usually triggered when a user opens a mobile app or a website in their browser and ends after a particular period of inactivity.

<div class="infoBlock">
A single session can contain multiple page views or screen views, events, social interactions, and e-commerce transactions.
</div>

With the help of RudderStack's **session tracking** feature, you can gather the event tracking metrics and combine it with the session metadata to better understand the user's product journey and analyze their behavior. You can also use the resulting insights to identify problems and optimization opportunities in your product workflow.

## Session tracking in RudderStack SDKs

The following RudderStack SDKs support the session tracking feature:

| RudderStack SDK | Minimum supported version |
| :---- | :---- |
| <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/">JavaScript</Link> | <strong>v1</strong> - 1.16.0 (CDN)<br /><strong>v1.1</strong> - 2.15.0 (CDN & NPM) |
| <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-android-sdk/">Android</Link> | <strong>v1.7.0</strong> |
| <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-ios-sdk/">iOS</Link> | <strong>v1.7.0</strong> |

<div class="infoBlock">
You can expect the following properties in your event's <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/common-fields/#contextual-fields"><code class="inline-code">context</code></Link> object when session tracking is enabled:
<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">sessionId</code> (Number): The unique session ID.</li>
<li><code class="inline-code">sessionStart</code> (Boolean): Present in the first event, indicating the start of the session.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="warningBlock">
It is strongly recommended to send any other session-related information in the event's traits or properties. When session tracking is enabled, RudderStack overrides any <code class="inline-code">sessionId</code> set in the event's <code class="inline-code">context</code> object.
</div>

## Automatic session tracking

**By default, the RudderStack SDKs automatically track the user sessions**. This means that RudderStack automatically determines the start and end of a session depending on the inactivity time configured in the SDK.

<div class="infoBlock">
RudderStack also lets you start and end user sessions manually. Refer to the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/session-tracking/manual-session-tracking">Manual session tracking</Link> guide for more information. <strong>Note that manual session tracking overrides the automatic session tracking</strong>.
</div>

### JavaScript SDK

For the JavaScript SDK, RudderStack considers the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/">SDK initialization</Link> as the start of a user session.

To disable automatic session tracking, you can set the `autoTrack` load option to `false`, as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {
  sessions: {
    autoTrack: false,  // Set to true to enable automatic session tracking
  },
  ...<otherLoadOptions>
});
```

### When does a session become inactive?

By default, a session is active until **30 minutes of inactivity** have elapsed since the last received event. Whenever RudderStack receives a new event, it checks if the inactivity period has elapsed. If yes, it starts a new session with a new `sessionId`. Otherwise, it continues the previous session.

Every time a new event is generated (`track`, `page`, `identify`, etc.), the SDK resets the session expiration time by adding the configured `timeout` (default **30 minutes**) to the last received event's <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/common-fields/#clock-skew-considerations">`timestamp`</Link>.

You can also adjust the inactivity period using the `timeout` load option. The following snippet highlights the use of the `timeout` option to set a custom session timeout of 10 minutes:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {
  sessions: {
    autoTrack: true,
    timeout: 10 * 60 * 1000,  // 10 min in milliseconds
  },
  ...<otherLoadOptions>
});
```

<div class="infoBlock">

</div>

### Mobile SDKs

<div class="warningBlock">
To automatically track sessions in the Android and iOS SDK, <code class="inline-code">withTrackLifecycleEvents</code> should also be set to true. This is because RudderStack considers the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/application-lifecycle-events-spec/#application-opened">Application Opened</Link>, <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/application-lifecycle-events-spec/#application-installed">Application Installed</Link>, or <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/application-lifecycle-events-spec/#application-updated">Application Updated</Link> events as the start of a new session.
</div>

#### Android

By default, automatic session tracking is enabled in the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-android-sdk/">Android</Link> SDK, as shown:

<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>Kotlin</Tab>
    <Tab>Java</Tab>
  </TabList>
    <TabPanels>
      <TabPanel>
<span>

```kotlin
val rudderClient = RudderClient.getInstance(
    this,
    WRITE_KEY,
    RudderConfig.Builder()
        .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)
        .withAutoSessionTracking(true)  // Set to false to disable automatic session tracking
        .withSessionTimeoutMillis(5*60*1000)
        .build()
)
```
</span>
      </TabPanel>
      <TabPanel>
<span>

```java
RudderClient rudderClient = RudderClient.getInstance(
    this,
    WRITE_KEY,
    new RudderConfig.Builder()
        .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)
        .withAutoSessionTracking(true) // Set to false to disable automatic session tracking
        .withSessionTimeoutMillis(5*60*1000)
        .build()
);
```
</span>
      </TabPanel>
    </TabPanels>
</Tabs>

To disable automatic session tracking, set `withAutoSessionTracking` to `false`.

#### iOS

By default, automatic session tracking is enabled in the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-ios-sdk/">iOS</Link> SDK, as shown:

<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>Objective-C</Tab>
    <Tab>Swift</Tab>
  </TabList>
    <TabPanels>
      <TabPanel>
<span>

```objectivec
RSConfigBuilder *builder = [[RSConfigBuilder alloc] init];
[builder withDataPlaneUrl:DATA_PLANE_URL];
[builder withAutoSessionTracking:YES];  // Set to No to disable automatic session tracking
[builder withSessionTimeoutMillis:(5*60*1000)];
[RSClient getInstance:WRITE_KEY config:[builder build]];
```
</span>
      </TabPanel>
      <TabPanel>
<span>

```swift
let builder: RSConfigBuilder = RSConfigBuilder()
            .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)
            .withAutoSessionTracking(true)  // Set to false to disable automatic session tracking
            .withSessionTimeoutMillis(5*60*1000)
RSClient.getInstance(WRITE_KEY, config: builder.build())
```
</span>
      </TabPanel>
    </TabPanels>
</Tabs>

To disable automatic session tracking, set `withAutoSessionTracking` to `false`.

#### Session expiration in mobile SDKs

By default, a session is active until **5 minutes of inactivity** have elapsed. However, you can adjust this limit using the `sessionTimeoutMillis` load option, as seen in the above snippets.

If the duration between the last received event and the next `Application Opened` event is more than `sessionTimeoutMillis`, RudderStack **automatically** starts a new session. Otherwise, it continues the previous session.

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on how session tracking works in the mobile SDKs, refer to the <Link to="#session-tracking-flow">Session tracking flow</Link> section below.
</div>

## Session tracking flow

The following sections describe how the session tracking works in the RudderStack SDKs.

### JavaScript SDK

If session tracking is enabled in the JavaScript SDK, the flow is as explained below:

1. During the initialization, the SDK checks for an existing user session. If no valid session exists, it creates a new session. Otherwise, the SDK proceeds with the existing session.
2. Upon receiving an event, the SDK fetches the `sessionId`. If no valid `sessionId` is found, it creates a new session and returns the `sessionId`. 
    - If this is the first event of the session, the SDK also sends another parameter in the context called `sessionStart: true`.

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on how RudderStack calculates <code class="inline-code">sessionId</code>, refer to the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/session-tracking/faq/#how-does-rudderstack-determine-the-sessionid">FAQ</Link> guide. 
</div>

3. The SDK records the user events and the session is active until the `timeout` (default **30 minutes** of inactivity) period has elapsed since the last received event. If yes, it starts a new session with a new `sessionId`.
4. Otherwise, the SDK updates the session expiration time by adding the last event's <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/common-fields/#clock-skew-considerations">`timestamp`</Link> to the `timeout` period (default **30 minutes**).

The following diagram summarizes the workflow:

### Mobile SDKs

If session tracking is enabled in the mobile SDKs, the flow is as explained below:

1. RudderStack starts the session once it receives the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/application-lifecycle-events-spec/#application-opened">`Application Opened`</Link>, <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/application-lifecycle-events-spec/#application-installed">`Application Installed`</Link>, or <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/application-lifecycle-events-spec/#application-updated">`Application Updated`</Link> event.
2. The SDK then generates a `sessionId`.

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on how RudderStack calculates <code class="inline-code">sessionId</code>, refer to the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/session-tracking/faq/#how-does-rudderstack-determine-the-sessionid">FAQ</Link> guide. 
</div>

3. The SDK records the user events and the session is active until more than `sessionTimeoutMillis` (default **5 minutes**) period of inactivity has elapsed since the last received event.

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information, refer to the <Link to="#session-expiration-in-mobile-sdks">Session expiration in the mobile SDKs</Link> section above.
</div>

The following diagram summarizes the workflow:

## Supported downstream tools

RudderStack supports forwarding the `sessionId` and `sessionStart` fields to the following downstream destinations:

<table style="table-layout: fixed; width: 100%;" >
<tr>
  <td style="width:40%;"><strong>Destination</strong></td>
  <td style="width:60%;"><strong>Notes</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><Link to="/destinations/streaming-destinations/amplitude/">Amplitude</Link></td>
  <td>RudderStack sends the <code class="inline-code">sessionId</code> parameter in the event which is mapped to <code class="inline-code">session_id</code> in Amplitude. For more information, refer to the <a href="https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/analytics/apis/http-v2-api/#keys-for-the-event-argument:~:text=to%20occur%20simultaneously.-,session_id,-Optional.%20Long.%20The">Amplitude documentation</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><Link to="/destinations/streaming-destinations/mixpanel/">Mixpanel</Link></td>
  <td><ul><li>RudderStack passes <code class="inline-code">$session_id</code> under the event properties.</li><li>Mixpanel doesn't have any specific field for <code class="inline-code">$session_id</code> but you can use this field in the reports.</li></ul></td>
</tr>
</table>

It is important to note the following:
- RudderStack passes the `sessionId` to the subsequent events in the `context.sessionId` field.
- RudderStack sets the `context.sessionStart` field to `true` in the first event to indicate the start of the session.
