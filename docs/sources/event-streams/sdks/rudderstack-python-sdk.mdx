## SDK setup requirements

1. Sign up to [RudderStack Cloud](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup).
2. <Link to="/dashboard-guides/sources/#adding-a-source">Set up a Python source</Link> in your dashboard. You should be able to see a <strong>write key</strong> for this source.

You will also need a data plane URL. Refer to the <Link to="/dashboard-guides/overview/#data-plane-url">Dashboard Overview</Link> guide for more information on the data plane URL and where to find it.


<div class="successBlock">
The <strong>Setup</strong> tab in the RudderStack dashboard (seen above) has the SDK installation snippet containing both the write key and the data plane URL. Copy it to integrate the Python SDK into your application.
</div>

## Installing the Python SDK

To install the RudderStack Python SDK using [**pip**](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), run the following command:

```bash
pip install rudder-sdk-python
```

## Initializing the RudderStack client

To initialize the SDK, run the following code snippet:

```python
import rudderstack.analytics as rudder_analytics

rudder_analytics.write_key = WRITE_KEY
rudder_analytics.dataPlaneUrl = DATA_PLANE_URL
```

### Initialization options

| `upload_size` | Number of events in the queue that triggers a flush. | `100` |

## Sending events

<div class="warningBlock">
<strong>RudderStack does not store or persist the user state in any of the server-side SDKs</strong>. <br /><br />Unlike the client-side SDKs that deal with only a single user at a given time, the server-side SDKs deal with multiple users simultaneously. Therefore, you must specify either the <code class="inline-code">user_id</code> or <code class="inline-code">anonymous_id</code> <strong>every time</strong> while making any API calls supported by the Python SDK.
</div>

### Identify

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify/">`identify`</Link> call lets you identify a visiting user and associate them to their actions. It also lets you record the traits about them like their name, email address, etc.

A sample `identify` call made using the Python SDK is shown below:

```python
rudder_analytics.identify('1hKOmRA4GRlm', {
    'email': 'alex@example.com',
    'name': 'John Doe',
    'friends': 16
})
```

The `identify` method parameters are as shown:

| **Field**      | **Type** |  **Description**     |
| :------------- | :------- |  :---------------- |
| `user_id` <br/> <span style="color: #4D4DFF;font-size:12px;">Required, if <strong>anonymous_id</strong> is absent.</span>     | String   | Unique identifier for a user in your database.      |
| `anonymous_id`  <br/> <span style="color: #4D4DFF;font-size:12px;">Required, if <strong>user_id</strong> is absent.</span> | String   |  The SDK automatically sets this identifier in cases where there is no unique identifier for the user. |
| `traits`  <br/> <span style="color: #4D4DFF;font-size:12px;">Required</span>     | Object   | An optional dictionary of the user's traits like `name` or `email`.     |

### Group

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/group/">`group`</Link> call lets you link an identified user with a group, such as a company, organization, or an account. It also lets you record any custom traits or properties associated with that group.

A sample `group` call made using the Python SDK is shown below:

```python
rudder_analytics.group('1hKOmRA4GRlm', '12', {
    'name': 'Company',
    'domain': 'IT'

### Alias

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/alias/">`alias`</Link> call lets you merge different identities of a known user. It is an advanced method that lets you change the tracked user's ID explicitly. You can use `alias` for managing the user's identity in some of the downstream destinations.

<div class="warningBlock">
RudderStack supports sending <code class="inline-code">alias</code> events only to select downstream destinations. Refer to the <Link to="/destinations/streaming-destinations/">destination-specific documentation</Link> for more details.
</div>

A sample `alias` call is as shown:

```python
rudder_analytics.alias('previous_id', 'user_id')
```

The `alias` method parameters are as shown:

| **Field**      | **Type** |  **Description**     |
| :------------- | :------- |  :---------------- |
| `user_id` <br/> <span style="color: #4D4DFF;font-size:12px;">Required, if <strong>anonymous_id</strong> is absent.</span>     | String   | Unique identifier for a user in your database.      |
| `previous_id` <br/> <span style="color: #4D4DFF;font-size:12px;">Required</span>  | String   | The previous unique identifier of the user.        |
| `integrations` | Object | An optional dictionary containing the destinations to be either enabled or disabled. |
| `context`      | Object   |  An optional dictionary of information that provides context about the event. It is not directly related to the API call.      |
| `timestamp`    | Timestamp in ISO 8601 format     | The timestamp of the event's arrival.     |
| `message_id` | String | A unique identifier for the event. The SDK generates this field automatically. It is **highly recommended** to not send this field unless there is a specific requirement or use case. | 

## Gzipping requests

The Python SDK automatically gzips requests. However, you can disable this feature by setting the `gzip` parameter to `false` while initializing the SDK, as shown:

```python
import rudderstack.analytics as rudder_analytics

rudder_analytics.write_key = WRITE_KEY
rudder_analytics.dataPlaneUrl = DATA_PLANE_URL
rudder_analytics.gzip = False
```

<div class="warningBlock">
Gzip requires <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server">rudder-server</a> <strong>v1.4 or higher</strong>. Otherwise, your events might fail.
</div>

## Flushing events

The Python SDK batches the events and flushes them in the background, for faster and more efficient operation. By default, the SDK flushes a batch of 100 events every 0.5 seconds since the last flush.

You can control the event flushing by tweaking the following parameters:

| Parameter        | Description                                | Default value |
| :----------------| :------------------------------------------| :-------------|
| `max_queue_size` | Maximum queue size the SDK uses to enqueue the events.             | `10000`           |
| `upload_interval` | Maximum duration between two upload (flush) activities. | `0.5s`          |

You can also flush the events explicitly by using the SDK's `flush()` method to make sure no events are left in the queue.

A sample flush call is shown below:

```python
rudder_analytics.flush()
```

<div class="warningBlock">
The SDK blocks the calling thread until all the messages are flushed from the queue. Hence, you should avoid using it as a part of your request lifecycle.
</div>

## Error handling

To handle errors that may occur when sending the events via the Python SDK, you can declare a callback called `on_error`.

```
def on_error(error, events):
    print("Error response:", error)

rudder_analytics.on_error = on_error
```

<div class="infoBlock">
This callback only returns the errors that occur with the HTTP requests to the gateway. It will not return any errors that occur while sending data to your downstream destinations.
</div>

Some of the common request responses are listed in the following table:

| Status                                    | Code |
| :-------------------- | :--- |
| OK                                          | 200  |
| Request neither has `anonymousId` nor `userId` | 400  |
| Invalid write key                          | 401  |
| Invalid JSON                               | 400  |
