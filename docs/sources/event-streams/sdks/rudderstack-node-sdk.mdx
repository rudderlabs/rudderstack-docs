---

RudderStack's Node SDK lets you track and send the events from your Node.js applications to the specified destinations.

<div class="infoBlock">
Refer to the Node SDK's <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-node">GitHub codebase</a> for the implementation-specific details.
</div>

<GhBadge
  url={'https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rudderstack/rudder-sdk-node/'}
  repo={'npm/v/@rudderstack/rudder-sdk-node'}
  style={'flat'}
/>

## SDK setup requirements

1. Sign up to [RudderStack Cloud](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup).
2. <Link to="/dashboard-guides/sources/#adding-a-source">Set up a Node source</Link> in the dashboard. You should be able to see the <strong>write key</strong> for this source, as shown:

<img src="../../../assets/event-stream-sources/node-write-key-new.png" alt="Node source write key" />

You will also need the data plane URL.  Refer to the <Link to="/dashboard-guides/overview/#data-plane-url">Dashboard Overview</Link> guide for more information on the data plane URL and where to find it.

<div class="successBlock">
The <strong>Setup</strong> tab in the RudderStack dashboard (seen above) has the SDK installation snippet containing both the write key and the data plane URL. Copy it to integrate the Node SDK into your application.
</div>

## Installing the Node.js SDK

To install the RudderStack Node.js SDK using [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/), run the following command:

```bash
npm install @rudderstack/rudder-sdk-node
```

## Using the SDK

Run the following snippet to use the Node.js SDK. It creates a global RudderStack client object that can be used for all the subsequent event requests.

## Identify

The `identify` call lets you identify a visiting user and capture any related information such as their name, email address, etc.

<div class="warningBlock">

RudderStack does not store the user state in any of the server-side SDKs. Unlike the client-side SDKs that deal with only a single user at a given time, the server-side SDKs deal with multiple users at the same time. Therefore, for any of the calls supported by the Node.js SDK, you need to specify either `userId` or `anonymousId` every time.
</div>

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
client.identify({
  userId: "123456",
  traits: {
    name: "Name Username",
    email: "name@website.com",
    plan: "Free",
    friends: 21,
  },
})
```

The `identify` parameters are as described below:

## Alias

The `alias` call lets you merge different identities of a known user.

<div class="infoBlock">

<code class="inline-code">alias</code> is an advanced method that lets you change the tracked user's ID explicitly. This method is useful when managing identities for some of the downstream destinations.
</div>

## Node.js SDK data persistence

<div class="warningBlock">

This feature is still in beta. Contact us on our <a href="https://rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack-community">Community Slack</a> if you face any issues.
</div>

If the Node.js SDK fails to successfully deliver the event data to RudderStack at the first attempt, it retries the event delivery. However, if, for some reason, RudderStack is unavailable for a longer duration, there is a possibility of data loss. To prevent this scenario, RudderStack has a data persistence feature to persist the events in **Redis**, leading to better event delivery guarantees. Also, the SDK can retry multiple times as the queue is maintained in a different process space (in this case, Redis).

<div class="infoBlock">
To use this feature, you will need to host a Redis server and use it as the intermediary data storage queue.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack uses <a href="https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull">Bull</a> as the interface layer between the Node.js SDK and Redis.

A sample SDK initialization is shown below:

```jsx
const client = new Analytics("write_key","server_url/v1/batch",{
    flushAt: <number> = 20,
    flushInterval: <ms> = 20000
    // the max number of elements that the SDK can hold in memory,
    // this is different than the Redis list created when persistence is enabled.
    // This restricts the data in-memory when Redis is down, unreachable etc.
    maxInternalQueueSize: <number> = 20000
});

client.createPersistenceQueue({ redisOpts: { host: "localhost" } }, err => {})
```

A sample SDK initialization is shown below:

```jsx
const client = new Analytics("WRITE_KEY", {
    dataPlaneUrl: DATA_PLANE_URL // default: https://hosted.rudderlabs.com with default path set to /v1/batch
    flushAt: <number> = 20,
    flushInterval: <ms> = 20000
    // the max number of elements that the SDK can hold in memory,
    // this is different than the Redis list created when persistence is enabled.
    // This restricts the data in-memory when Redis is down, unreachable etc.
    maxInternalQueueSize: <number> = 20000
});

client.createPersistenceQueue({ redisOpts: { host: "localhost" } }, err => {})
```
</span>
      </TabPanel>
    </TabPanels>
</Tabs>

To achieve the data persistence, you need to call the `createPersistenceQueue` method which takes two parameters as input - `queueOpts` and a `callback`. This will initialize the persistent queue.

<div class="warningBlock">

If the createPersistenceQueue method is not called after initializing the SDK, the SDK will work without any persistence.
</div>

### `queueOpts`

As mentioned in the previous section, you need to call the `createPersistenceQueue` method which takes two parameters as input - `queueOpts` and a `callback`- to achieve data persistence. This method will initialize the persistent queue.

`client.createPersistenceQueue(QueueOpts, callback)`

Calling the `createPersistenceQueue` method will initialize a Redis list by calling [**Bull's**](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull) utility methods. It will also add a **single** job processor for the processing \(making requests to RudderStack\) jobs that are pushed into the list. Any error encountered while doing this leads to a callback with the error.

A sample `queueOpts` initialization is shown below:

```javascript
queueOpts {
    queueName ?: string = rudderEventsQueue,
    isMultiProcessor ? : boolean = false
    // pass a value without the {}, this will used as prefix to Redis keys,
    // needed to support Redis cluster slots.
    prefix ? : string = {rudder},
    redisOpts : RedisOpts,
    jobOpts ?: JobOpts
}
```

The specification of the different `queueOpts` parameters is listed in the following table:

| **Parameter** | **Description** | **Default Value** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `queueName` | Name of the queue. | `20` |
| `isMultiProcessor` | Determines whether to handle previously active jobs. If set to `false`, the previously active job will be picked up first by the processor. Otherwise, Bull moves this job to the back of the Redis queue to be picked up after the already pushed event. | `false` |
| `prefix` | Used as the prefix to the Redis keys needed to support the Redis cluster slots. | `20000` |
| `redisOpts` | Refer to the `RedisOpts` section below | `RedisOpts` |
| `jobOpts` | Refer to the `JobOpts` section below | `JobOpts` |

<div class="warningBlock">

If the same queue \(RudderStack SDK initialized with the same queue name\) is used in case of multiple servers \(server-side SDKs\), set the value of `isMultiProcessor` to `true` as event ordering is not applicable in this case.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

More information on this parameter can be found in the [**Bull docs**](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull/blob/develop/REFERENCE.md#queue).
</div>

#### `RedisOpts`

```jsx
RedisOpts {
    port?: number = 6379;
    host?: string = localhost;
    db?: number = 0;
    password?: string;
}
```

<div class="infoBlock">

More information on this parameter can be found in the [**Bull docs**](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull/blob/develop/REFERENCE.md#queue).
</div>

#### `JobOpts`

```javascript
JobOpts {
    maxAttempts ? : number = 10
}
```

### `callback`

In case of an error, the `createPersistenceQueue` method returns a callback. You should retry sending the events in this scenario.

```jsx
// createPersistenceQueue calls this with error or nothing(in case of success), // user should retry in case of error
callback: function(error) || function()
```

Calling the `createPersistenceQueue` method will initialize a Redis list by calling [**Bull's**](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull) utility methods. It will also add a **single** job processor for the processing \(making requests to RudderStack\) jobs that are pushed into the list. Any error encountered while doing this leads to calling `callback` with the error.

<div class="infoBlock">

If the callback returns with an error, we recommend retrying calling `createPersistenceQueue` with a backoff.

</div>

###  Event flow

- Calling the SDK methods like `track`, `page`, `identify`, etc. pushes the events to an in-memory array.
- The events from the array are flushed as a `batch` to the Redis persistence based on the `flushAt` and `flushInterval` settings. The in-memory array has a maximum size of `maxInternalQueueSize`. **Once this size limit is reached,** __**the events won't be accepted if not drained to the other side \(cases where Redis connection is slow or the Redis server is not reachable\).**
- The processor will take the batch from the Redis list and make a request to RudderStack. In case of an error, the processor will retry sending the data again if the error can be retried \(errors with status code `5xx and 429`\). **The retry will go up to `JobOpts.maxAttempts` with an** **exponential backoff of power 2 with max backoff of 30 seconds**.
- If the job fails even after `JobOpts.maxAttempts`, it will not be retried again and pushed to a `failed queue`. **You can retry them later manually using Bull’s utility methods** [**listed here**](https://github.com/OptimalBits/bull/blob/develop/REFERENCE.md#queuegetfailed) **or get them from Redis directly**.
- There might be a scenario where the node process dies with the jobs still in active state \(not completed nor failed but in the process of sending/retrying\). Since the RudderStack SDK has only **1 processor for sending events** \(this count should always be **1**\), the next time the SDK is initialized and `createPersistenceQueue` is called, **the jobs will be picked up first by the processor to get processed to maintain event ordering based on the value of `QueueOpts.isMultiProcessor`**.
- For multiple servers \(SDK\) connecting to the same queue \(`QueueOpts.queueName`\), there will be multiple processors fetching events from the same queue and event ordering won’t be implemented. Hence, `QueueOpts.isMultiProcessor` should be set to **`true`.**
