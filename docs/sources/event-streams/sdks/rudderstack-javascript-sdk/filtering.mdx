This guide covers how to achieve the following filtering operations:
* Filtering events while sending them to the specified destinations.
* Filtering destinations where the SDK sends the event data.

## Filtering events

When sending events to a destination via the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">**web device mode**</Link>, you can specify which events should be discarded or allowed to flow through - by allowlisting or denylisting them using the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/">Client-side Event Filtering</Link> feature.

## Filtering destinations

You can send the event data only to the selective destinations by passing an <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/#integrationopts">integrations</Link>  object in the **loadOptions** parameter. RudderStack then loads or sends events only to the specified and enabled destinations.

* A sample snippet to send event data only to the **Google Analytics** and **Intercom** destinations:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {
    integrations: {
        All: false,
        "Google Analytics": true,
        "Intercom": true
    }
});
```

* A sample `track` method to send event data only to the **Google Analytics** destination:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(
    "Order Completed", {
        revenue: 30,
        currency: "USD",
        user_actual_id: 12345
    }, {
        integrations: {
            All: false,
            "Google Analytics": true
        }
    }
);
```
The <Link to="/destinations/streaming-destinations/">destinaton</Link> name inside the `integrations` object should be in the specified format, such as:

* Google Analytics: `Google Analytics`/`GoogleAnalytics`/`GA`
* Kochava:     `Kochava`    
* Amplitude: `Amplitude`/`AMPLITUDE`
