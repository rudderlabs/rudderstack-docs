description: Detailed guide on detecting ad-blocked pages via the RudderStack JavaScript SDK.
---

The JavaScript SDK provides a way to send a page view containing relevant markers that determine whether a page is ad-blocked. You can analyze this data to find what percent of your website's page views are affected by ad blockers.

## Sending an ad-blocked page view

To send an ad-blocked page view, load the JavaScript SDK as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {
  sendAdblockPage: true,
  sendAdblockPageOptions: {
    integrations: {
      All: false,
      Amplitude: true
    }
  }
});
```

The following sections describe the properties included in the snippet above.

### `sendAdblockPage`

This property enables the JavaScript SDK to make a call to load the [**Google AdSense**](https://www.google.com/adsense/start/) library. If RudderStack fails to load this library, it concludes that an ad blocker is enabled on the page.

<div class="infoBlock">

Since most ad blockers block the request to the Google AdSense servers, we assume this approach to be a good measure to detect ad-blocked pages.

</div>

### `sendAdblockPageOptions`

The JavaScript SDK will make an implicit `page` call about the ad-blocked pages if `sendAdblockPage` is set to `true`.

With `sendAdblockPageOptions` \(which internally contains the [**`IntegrationOpts`**](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/#integrationopts) object\), you can provide the destinations to which you want to forward this `page` call.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on filtering destinations, refer to the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/#filtering-selective-destinations">Filtering selective destinations</a> section of the SDK guide.

</div>

The implicit `page` call semantics is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page(
  "RudderJS-Initiated",
  "ad-block page request",
  {
    path: "/ad-blocked",
    title:
      "error in script loading:: src::  http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js id:: ad-block"
  },
  sendAdblockPageOptions
);
```
