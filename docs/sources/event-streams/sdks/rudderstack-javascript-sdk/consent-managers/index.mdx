## FAQ

### Can I integrate the RudderStack JavaScript SDK with any consent manager?

Currently, RudderStack only supports integration with <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/consent-managers/onetrust/">OneTrust cookie consent manager</Link>.

However, you can use a workaround to integrate some other consent manager by managing the cookie consent yourself and translating that information into a list of destinations which need to be loaded/blocked. Once done, load the JavaScript SDK to <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/#filtering-selective-destinations">filter the destinations</Link> via the `integrations` object.
