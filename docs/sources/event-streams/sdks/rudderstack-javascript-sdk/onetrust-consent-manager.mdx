  Detailed technical documentation on integrating RudderStack with the OneTrust consent management platform.

Consent managers offer various cookie consent solutions allowing the customers to determine what personal data they want to share with a business.

<div class="infoBlock">
Data protection laws such as GDPR, CCPA, etc., require the websites to get user consent for collecting their data through cookies.
</div>

[OneTrust](https://www.onetrust.com/) is a popular consent management platform that provides data governance, privacy management, and security solutions to thousands of businesses worldwide. 

The JavaScript SDK seamlessly integrates with the OneTrust SDK. It lets you map the OneTrust cookie/consent groups to RudderStack's consent purposes. RudderStack, in turn, uses this consent information to enable/disable the tracking and sending of data.

<div class="warningBlock">
The OneTrust integration with the JavaScript SDK is applicable only for the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">device mode</a> connections.

## How the RudderStack-OneTrust integration works

Whenever a user starts browsing a website, OneTrust pops up a modal to take consent from the user. This modal contains a list of cookie groups representing the GDPR consent purposes that the user needs to decline or accept.

The JavaScript SDK fetches these consented groups and the destination (OneTrust category) mappings specified in the RudderStack dashboard. Depending on these settings, the SDK filters the destinations.

## Setting up the integration

The following sections highlight the steps to set up the JavaScript SDK integration with OneTrust.

### Step 1: Configuring OneTrust

Follow these steps to configure OneTrust for your web app:

1. Create a [OneTrust account](https://my.onetrust.com/s/login/SelfRegister?language=en_US&startURL=%2Fs%2F%3Ft%3D1587743884774) and get subscription to their <Link to="https://www.onetrust.com/products/cookie-consent/">Cookie Consent</Link> product.
2. Navigate to **Websites** > **Add Websites**. 
3. Enter your top-level website URL to scan and click **Start Scan**.
4. Go to the **Categorizations** tab and define the new categories or modify the existing ones, as required.

<div class="infoBlock">
The categories should be associated with/attached to at least one cookie to be displayed in your RudderStack dashboard's OneTrust modal.
</div>

5. Go to the **Scripts** tab, select the domain to be published and click **Publish** to publish the script.

### Step 2: Specifying the OneTrust Cookie Categories

You need to enable OneTrust for a given JavaScript source. To do so, specify the consent category names defined in OneTrust (**Step 1**) for each destination connected to that JavaScript source.

### Step 3: Setting up your website

1. Load the OneTrust script that you published in your web app in <Link to="#step-1-configuring-onetrust">Step 1</Link>, as shown below:

```javascript

<!-- OneTrust Cookies Consent Notice start for samplewebsite.com -->
<script
        src="https://cdn.cookielaw.org/scripttemplates/otSDKStub.js"
        type="text/javascript"
        charset="UTF-8"
        data-domain-script="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" >
</script>
<script type="text/javascript">
        // Required OneTrust callback
        function OptanonWrapper() { }
</script>
<!-- OneTrust Cookies Consent Notice end for samplewebsite.com -->
```

2. **Load the JavaScript SDK only after a user provides consent.**

The JavaScript SDK determines the events to send to a destination based on the user's consent type.

One way to load the JavaScript SDK after the user provides the consent is to modify the `OptanonWrapper()` callback function provided by OneTrust, as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {
    cookieConsentManager: {
        oneTrust: {
            enabled: true
        }
    },
    //other options
});
```

<div class="infoBlock">
If a user updates the consent settings, the web page must be refreshed for the changes to take effect in the SDK.
</div>

3. Add the `cookieConsentManager` option in the `load()` call as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {
        cookieConsentManager: {
            oneTrust: {
                enabled: true
            }
        },
        //other options
    }
);
```

Once completed, RudderStack reads the consented categories and filters the destinations accordingly.

<div class="infoBlock">
Replace <Link to="/resources/glossary/#write-key"><code class="inline-code">WRITE_KEY</code></Link> and <Link to="/dashboard-guides/overview/#data-plane-url"><code class="inline-code">DATA_PLANE_URL</code></Link> in the above snippet with the actual values.
</div>
