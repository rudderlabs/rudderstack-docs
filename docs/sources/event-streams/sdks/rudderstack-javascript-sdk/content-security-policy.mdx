The JavaScript SDK
* We can talk about the content security policy issue and the need for whitelisting domains.
Rather than hosting all that info in one place, each destination should have a section/note at the end displaying the domain if it supports web device mode.

* discuss steps to whitelisting domains as it'd be customer specific

add the domain in the allowed domains?

* the domains used for different device mode integrations

Reference to get the domain from supported destination docs.
