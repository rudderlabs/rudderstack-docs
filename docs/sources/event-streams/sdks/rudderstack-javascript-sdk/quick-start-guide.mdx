This guide lists the steps to quickly install and use the JavaScript SDK to identify your website users and track their actions.

## Prerequisites

To set up and use the RudderStack JavaScript SDK, the following prerequisites must be met:

- Set up a [**RudderStack account**](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup).
- <Link to="/dashboard-guides/sources/#adding-a-source">Set up a JavaScript source</Link> in the RudderStack dashboard.
 
## Step 1: Install JavaScript SDK 

### Using CDN

To integrate the SDK with your website and load it **asynchronously**:
1. Go to the **Setup** tab of your JavaScript source in the dashboard.
2. Copy the following snippet by clicking on **Copy Snippet** and paste it in your website's `<head>` section:

<img src="../../../../assets/event-stream-sources/javascript-setup-new.png" alt="JavaScript source write key" />

<div class="successBlock">
The SDK installation snippet (seen above) contains both the <Link to="/resources/glossary/#write-key"><code class="inline-code">WRITE_KEY</code></Link> and <Link to="/dashboard-guides/overview/#data-plane-url"><code class="inline-code">DATA_PLANE_URL</code></Link>, by default.
</div>

Alternatively, you can copy and use the below snippet (same as above) by replacing the <Link to="/resources/glossary/#write-key">`WRITE_KEY`</Link> and <Link to="/dashboard-guides/overview/#data-plane-url">`DATA_PLANE_URL`</Link> with the actual values.

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
!function(){var e=window.rudderanalytics=window.rudderanalytics||[];e.methods=["load","page","track","identify","alias","group","ready","reset","getAnonymousId","setAnonymousId","getUserId","getUserTraits","getGroupId","getGroupTraits","startSession","endSession"],e.factory=function(t){return function(){var r=Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);return r.unshift(t),e.push(r),e}};for(var t=0;t<e.methods.length;t++){var r=e.methods[t];e[r]=e.factory(r)}e.loadJS=function(e,t){var r=document.createElement("script");r.type="text/javascript",r.async=!0,r.src="https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/rudder-analytics.min.js";var a=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];a.parentNode.insertBefore(r,a)},e.loadJS(),
e.load(<WRITE_KEY>,<DATA_PLANE_URL>),
e.page()}();
</script>
```

To integrate the SDK with your website and load it **synchronously**, add any of the following scripts in your website's `<head>` section.

**Minified code**

```javascript
<script>
rudderanalytics=window.rudderanalytics=[];for(var methods=["load","page","track","identify","alias","group","ready","reset","getAnonymousId","setAnonymousId","getUserId","getUserTraits","getGroupId","getGroupTraits","startSession","endSession"],i=0;i<methods.length;i++){var method=methods[i];rudderanalytics[method]=function(a){return function(){rudderanalytics.push([a].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)))}}(method)}rudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY,DATA_PLANE_URL),rudderanalytics.page();
</script>

<script src="https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/rudder-analytics.min.js"></script>
```

**Non-minified code**

```javascript
<script>
  rudderanalytics = window.rudderanalytics = [];
  var methods = [
    "load",
    "page",
    "track",
    "identify",
    "alias",
    "group",
    "ready",
    "reset",
    "getAnonymousId",
    "setAnonymousId",
    "getUserId",
    "getUserTraits",
    "getGroupId",
    "getGroupTraits",
    "startSession",
    "endSession"
  ];
  for (var i = 0; i < methods.length; i++) {
    var method = methods[i];
    rudderanalytics[method] = (function (methodName) {
      return function () {
        rudderanalytics.push(
          [methodName].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments))
        );
      };
    })(method);
  }

  rudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY,DATA_PLANE_URL);
  rudderanalytics.page();
</script>

<script src="https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/rudder-analytics.min.js"></script>
```

<div class="infoBlock">
Replace <Link to="/resources/glossary/#write-key"><code class="inline-code">WRITE_KEY</code></Link> and <Link to="/dashboard-guides/overview/#data-plane-url"><code class="inline-code">DATA_PLANE_URL</code></Link> in the above snippet with the actual values.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">
There is an explicit <code class="inline-code">page</code> call at the end in all the above snippets. This is to ensure that a <code class="inline-code">page</code> call is sent whenever the SDK loads on a page. You can remove this call or modify it with any extra <code class="inline-code">page</code> properties. You can also add <code class="inline-code">page</code> calls in your application in places not tied directly to page load, for example, virtual page views and page renders on route change, such as in <Link to="#single-page-application">single-page applications</Link>.
</div>

### Using NPM 

While it is recommended to use the above method to integrate the JavaScript SDK with your website, you can alternatively use the [NPM module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rudder-sdk-js) for packaging RudderStack directly into your project.

To install the JavaScript SDK via NPM, run the following command:

```bash
npm install rudder-sdk-js --save
```

<div class="warningBlock">
Use this NPM module only for browser installation. To integrate RudderStack with your Node.js apps, refer to the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-node-sdk/">RudderStack Node.js SDK</Link> documentation.
</div>

Since the NPM module exports the related APIs on an already-defined object combined with the Node.js module caching, you should run the following code snippet **once** and use the exported object throughout your project:

```jsx
import * as rudderanalytics from "rudder-sdk-js";
rudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL);
rudderanalytics.ready(() => {
  console.log("We are all set!!!");
});
export { rudderanalytics };
```

Alternatively, you can do this with **ES5** using the `require` method, as shown:

```jsx
var rudderanalytics = require("rudder-sdk-js");
rudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL);
rudderanalytics.ready(() => {
  console.log("We are all set!!!");
});
exports.rudderanalytics = rudderanalytics;
```

<div class="infoBlock">
Replace <Link to="/resources/glossary/#write-key"><code class="inline-code">WRITE_KEY</code></Link> and <Link to="/dashboard-guides/overview/#data-plane-url"><code class="inline-code">DATA_PLANE_URL</code></Link> in the above snippet with the actual values.
</div>

The related APIs exported by the module are `load`, `ready`, `identify`, `alias`, `page`, `track`, `group`, `reset`, `getAnonymousId`, `setAnonymousId`, `getUserId`, `getUserTraits`, `getGroupId`, and `getGroupTraits`.

<div class="infoBlock">
Refer to the sample <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-analytics-angular">Angular</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-analytics-react">React</a> projects for a detailed walkthrough of the above steps.
</div>

The installation code snippets discussed above perform the following actions:

- Creates an array to store the events until the `analytics` object is ready.
- Stores the following methods to replay them when the `analytics` object is ready:

| Method           | Description                                          |
| :--------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/load-js-sdk/">`load()`</Link>     | Loads `analytics.js` with the specified write key. |
| <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#track">`track()`</Link>   | Tracks user events along with the associated properties.          |
| <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#identify">`identify()`</Link> | Identifies the users, records their traits, and associates them with their actions.        |
|<Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#alias">`alias()`</Link>    | Maps a new user ID with an old ID.       |
|<Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#group">`group()`</Link>    |  Links an identified user with a group such as a company, organization, or an account.       |
| <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/quick-start-guide/#step-2-check-ready-state">`ready()`</Link>   | Fired when the SDK has initialized itself and the other third-party native SDK destinations.       |
|<Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#reset">`reset()`</Link>    | Resets the information related to the previously identified user.       |
|`getAnonymousId`   |  Fetches the current `anonymousId`.       |
|`setAnonymousId`   | Sets the `anonymousId`.       |
| `getUserId`   | Fetches the current `userId`.      |
|`getUserTraits` |  Fetches the current user traits.       |
| `getGroupId`    | Fetches the current `groupId`.       |
| `getGroupTraits`  | Fetches the current group traits.       |
| `startSession`    | Starts a new session.       |
| `endSession`  | Clears the `sessionId` and ends the current session.     |

- Loads the analytics object with the specified write key.
- Makes a `page()`call to track the page views. It captures the whole URL including the UTM parameters as part of the `page` call payload, such as `path`, `referrer`, `search`, `title`, and `URL`. Refer to the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/page/#properties">`page`</Link> method to override these properties.

## Step 2: Check ready state

The JavaScript SDK provides the `ready` API with a `callback` parameter that triggers when the SDK is done initializing itself and the other third-party native SDK destinations.

An example is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.ready(() => {
    console.log("All set!");
});
```

## Step 3: Identify users

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/identify/">`identify`</Link> method lets you identify a user and associate them with their actions. It also enables you to record any traits about them like their name, email, etc.

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify(
    "1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm", {
        firstName: "Alex",
        lastName: "Keener",
        email: "alex@example.com",
        phone: "+1-202-555-0146"
    }, {
        page: {
            path: "/best-seller/1",
            referrer: "https://www.google.com/search?q=estore+bestseller",
            search: "estore bestseller",
            title: "The best sellers offered by EStore",
            url: "https://www.estore.com/best-seller/1"
        }
    },
    () => {
        console.log("identify call");
    }
);
```

The JavaScript SDK captures the `userId`, `email` and the <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/common-fields/#contextual-fields">contextual information</Link> from the above snippet.

<div class="infoBlock">
The anonymous visitors are automatically assigned an <code class="inline-code">anonymousId</code>. Refer to the <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/supported-api/#anonymous-id">Anonymous ID</Link> section for more information.
</div>

## Step 4: Track user actions

The <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track/"><code class="inline-code">track</code></Link> method lets you capture user events along with the associated properties.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(
    "Order Completed", {
        revenue: 77.6,
        currency: "USD",
    },
    () => {
        console.log("track call");
    }
);
```

The JavaScript SDK captures the `Order Completed` event along with `revenue`, `currency`, and `anonymousId` from the above snippet.

<div class="successBlock">
You can use the <code class="inline-code">track</code> method to track various success metrics for your website like user signups, item purchases, article bookmarks, and more.
</div>


## Supported browsers

The JavaScript SDK supports the following browsers and their corresponding versions:

| Browser         | Supported Versions |
| :------------------ | :--------------------- |
| Safari              | v7 or later            |
| IE                  | v10 or later           |
| Edge                | v80 or later           |
| Mozilla Firefox     | v47 or later           |
| Chrome              | v54 or later           |
| Opera               | v43 or later           |


<div class="infoBlock">
You can try adding the browser <Link to="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill">polyfills</Link> to your application if the SDK does not work on your browser.
</div>

## Single-page application

The JavaScript SDK makes a `page` call after its initialization (explicitly called at the end of the installation script). However, in the case of a single-page application (SPA) where a route change does not reload the page, you need to make the `page` call explicitly after the route change on the frontend.
