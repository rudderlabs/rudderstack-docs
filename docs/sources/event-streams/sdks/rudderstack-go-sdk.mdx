  Detailed technical documentation on using RudderStackâ€™s Go SDK to send events
  to various destinations
---

The **RudderStack Go SDK** lets you track your customer event data from your Go applications and send it to your specified destinations via RudderStack.

Check out the [**GitHub codebase**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/analytics-go) to get a more hands-on understanding of the SDK.

## SDK setup requirements

To set up the RudderStack Go SDK, the following prerequisites must be met:

- You need to set up a [**RudderStack account**](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup).
- Once signed up, <Link to="/dashboard-guides/sources/#adding-a-source">set up a Go source</Link> in the dashboard. You should be able to see a **Write Key** for this source, as shown below:

<img src="../../../assets/event-stream-sources/go-write-key-new.png" alt="Go source write key" />

- You will also need a data plane URL. Refer to the <Link to="/resources/glossary/#data-plane-url">Glossary</Link> for more information on the data plane URL and where to find it.

<div class="successBlock">
The <strong>Setup</strong> tab in the RudderStack dashboard (seen above) has an SDK installation snippet containing both the write key and the data plane URL. You can use it to integrate the Go SDK into your application.
</div>

## Installing the Go SDK

You can install the RudderStack Go SDK via the `go get` command. We highly recommend that you use a tool like **Godep** to avoid the issues related to any breaking API changes introduced between major versions of the library.

To install it in the `GOPATH`, run the following:

```go
go get github.com/rudderlabs/analytics-go
```

## Using the Go SDK

To use the SDK, run the following code snippet:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/rudderlabs/analytics-go"
)

func main() {
    // Instantiates a client to use send messages to the Rudder API.
    client := analytics.New(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL)

    // Enqueues a track event that will be sent asynchronously.
    client.Enqueue(analytics.Track{
        UserId: "test-user",
        Event:  "test-snippet",
    })

    // Flushes any queued messages and closes the client.
    client.Close()
}
```

Alternatively, you can run the following snippet:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/rudderlabs/analytics-go"
)

func main() {
    // Instantiates a client to use send messages to the Rudder API.
    client, _ := analytics.NewWithConfig(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL,
        analytics.Config{
            Interval:  30 * time.Second,
            BatchSize: 100,
            Verbose:   true,
        })

    // Enqueues a track event that will be sent asynchronously.
    client.Enqueue(analytics.Track{
        UserId: "test-user",
        Event:  "test-snippet",
    })

    // Flushes any queued messages and closes the client.
    client.Close()
}
```

The `Config` object parameters are described in the following table:

| **Field**               | **Type**      | **Presence** | **Description**                                                                          |
| :---------------------- | :------------ | :----------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Interval`              | time.Duration | Optional     | Messages will be sent when this flushing interval time triggers                          |
| `BatchSize`             | int           | Optional     | Total number of messages to be sent in a single batch                                    |
| `Verbose`               | bool          | Optional     | When set to true, the client will send more frequent and detailed messages to its logger |
| `RetryAfter`            | time.Duration | Optional     | This can be used to set up how long the failed messages can be retried                   |
| `maxConcurrentRequests` | int           | Optional     | The maximum number of parallel goroutines which will be spawned                          |
| `NoProxySupport`        | bool          | Optional     | Setting this variable to true will disable making calls to cluster-info end point        |

Users who do not use a proxy should set the `NoProxySupport` parameter to `true` while initializing the config.

```go
    // Instantiates a client to use send messages to the Rudder API.
    client, _ := analytics.NewWithConfig(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL,
        analytics.Config{
            Interval:  30 * time.Second,
            BatchSize: 100,
            NoProxySupport:   true,
        })
```

<div class="infoBlock">

Setting <code class="inline-code">NoProxySupport</code> to <code class="inline-code">true</code> will avoid RudderStack making calls to the proxy for fetching the total number of nodes, in case of multi-node setup.
</div>

## Identify

The `identify` call lets you identify a visiting user and capture any related information such as their name, email address, etc.

<div class="warningBlock">

RudderStack does not store the user state in any of the server-side SDKs. Unlike the client-side SDKs that deal with only a single user at a given time, the server-side SDKs deal with multiple users at the same time. Therefore, for any of the calls supported by the Node.js SDK, you need to specify either `userId` or `anonymousId` every time.
</div>

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```go
client.Enqueue(analytics.Identify{
  UserId: "123",
  Traits: analytics.NewTraits().
    SetName("Name Surname").
    SetEmail("name@example.com").
    Set("plan", "Free").
    Set("manager", 12),
})
```

The `identify` method parameters are as described below:

| **Field**      | **Type** | **Presence**                              | **Description**                                                                                                            |
| :------------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `anonymousId`  | String   | Optional                                  | Sets the user ID for cases where there is no unique identifier for the user. Either `userId` or `anonymousId` is required. |
| `userId`       | String   | Optional, if `anonymousId` is already set | Unique identifier for a particular user in your database.                                                                  |
| `context`      | Object   | Optional                                  | Dictionary of information that provides context about a message. However, it is not directly related to the API call.      |
| `integrations` | Object   | Optional                                  | A dictionary containing the destinations to be either enabled or disabled.                                                 |
| `timestamp`    | Date     | Optional                                  | The timestamp of the message's arrival.                                                                                    |
| `traits`       | Object   | Optional                                  | Dictionary of the traits associated with the user, such as `name`or `email`                                                |

## Track

The `track` call lets you record the user actions along with their associated properties. Each user action is called an **event**.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```go
client.Enqueue(analytics.Track{
  UserId: "123",
  Event:  "Signed Up",
  Properties: analytics.NewProperties().
    Set("plan", "Free"),

## Page

The `page` call allows you to record the page views on your website along with the other relevant information about the viewed page.

A sample `page` call is as shown:

```go
client.Enqueue(analytics.Page{
  UserId: "12345",
  Name:   "Pizza",
  Properties: analytics.NewProperties().
    SetURL("https://dominos.com"),
})
```

The `page` method parameters are as described below:

| **Field**      | **Type** | **Presence**                              | **Description**                                                                                                            |

## Group

The `group` call lets you associate an identified user to a group - either a company, project or a team and record any custom traits or properties associated with that group.

A sample `group` call is as shown:

```go
client.Enqueue(analytics.Group{
  UserId:  "12345",
  GroupId: "1",
  Traits: map[string]interface{}{
    "name": "Company",

## Alias

The `alias` call lets you merge different identities of a known user.

<div class="infoBlock">

<code class="inline-code">alias</code> is an advanced method that lets you change the tracked user's ID explicitly. This method is useful when managing identities for some of the downstream destinations.
</div>

A sample `alias` call is as shown:

```go
client.Enqueue(analytics.Alias{
  PreviousId: "12345",
  UserId:     "45678",
})
```

The `alias` method parameters are as mentioned below:

| **Field**      | **Type** | **Presence**                              | **Description**                                                                                                       |
| :------------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `userId`       | String   | Optional, if `anonymousId` is already set | Unique identifier for a particular user in your database.                                                             |
