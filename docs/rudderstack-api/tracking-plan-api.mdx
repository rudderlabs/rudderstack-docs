  Detailed technical description of the Tracking Plan API to programmatically manage your tracking plans.
---

The **Tracking Plan API** lets you build applications or scripts on top of RudderStack's Tracking Plan capabilities. You can use the Tracking Plan API to:

- Create/update/fetch tracking plans
- Define the tracking plan rules
- Connect a source to a tracking plan

This guide covers the details related to the usage of Tracking Plan API.

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be met to use the Tracking Plan API successfully:

* Set up a source-destination connection in RudderStack. For more details, refer to <Link to="/get-started">Get Started</Link> guide.

* Generate a <Link to="/rudderstack-api/personal-access-tokens">Personal Access Token</Link> in the RudderStack dashboard to authenticate the API successfully.

## API Authorization

RudderStack uses **Basic Authentication** for authenticating all the API requests.

<div class="successBlock">
All the popular HTTP clients \(e.g. CURL, Postman, HTTPie\) have default support for Basic Authentication.
</div>

The Basic Authentication for this API requires a username and password, where:

* The username is the **email address** you used to sign up for RudderStack.
* The password is the **personal access token** generated previously.

For example, if the email address is `name@surname.com` and the personal access token is `1zl4GJkLu0HsBdrDK88NgYZzY2E`, your request must have the following HTTP header:

```bash
Authorization: Basic bmFtZUBzdXJuYW1lLmNvbToxemw0R0prTHUwSHNCZHJESzg4TmdZWnpZMkU=
```

<div class="infoBlock">
In case of the <strong>Invalid Authorization Header</strong> error, verify if the email address and the personal access token are valid.
</div>

<div class="successBlock">
You can use this <a href="https://www.blitter.se/utils/basic-authentication-header-generator/">Basic Authentication Header Generator</a> to generate the HTTP header.
</div>
