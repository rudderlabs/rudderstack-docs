description: Detailed technical description of the Screen API call.

The `screen` call lets you record whenever your user views their mobile screen with any additional relevant information about the screen.

<div class="successBlock">

  The `screen` call is the mobile equivalent of the `page` call.
</div>

## Sample Payload

A sample payload of a `screen` call with most of the [**Common Fields**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/common-fields/) removed is as shown:

```javascript
{
  "type": "screen",
  "name": "Main",
  "properties": {
    "prop_key": "prop_value"
  }
}
```

The corresponding event that generates the above payload via the [**iOS SDK**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-ios-sdk/) is as shown:

```javascript
[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@"Main"
                properties:@{@"prop_key" : @"prop_value"}];
```

## Screen Fields

Apart from the [**Common Fields**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/common-fields/), the `screen` call accepts the following fields:

| **Field**    | **Type** | **Presence** | **Description**                                                                                                                              |
| :----------- | :------- | :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`       | String   | Optional     | The name of the screen.                                                                                                                      |
| `properties` | Object   | Optional     | Includes the properties of the screen such as the `url`, `referrer`, etc. For more more information, check the [**Properties**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/screen/#properties) section below. |

## Properties

Properties are additional information that describe the viewed screen.

RudderStack has reserved some standard properties listed in the table below and handles them in special ways.

| **Property** | **Type** | **Description**                                                                    |
| :----------- | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`       | String   | You can tag each screen with a `name`. This is a reserved property for future use. |
