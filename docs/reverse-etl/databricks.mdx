[Azure Databricks](https://databricks.com/) is a data analytics platform that lets you easily integrate with open source libraries. It offers a simple collaborative environment to run interactive and scheduled data analysis workloads.

RudderStack supports Databricks as a source from which you can ingest data and route it to your desired downstream destinations.

## Setting up the Databricks source in RudderStack

### Naming the source

1. Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com).
2. From the left panel, go to **Source** > **New Source** > **Reverse ETL**. Then, select **Databricks**, as shown:

3. Assign a name to your source.

### Configuring the connection credentials

   - **Host** - Enter the server hostname.
   - **Port** - Enter the port number.
   - **Path** - Enter the HTTP path.

2. Click on **Continue** to proceed.

### Schedule settings

1. Specify the **Schedule Settings** to schedule the data syncs from your Databricks source.

RudderStack lets you schedule data syncs for your Reverse ETL sources and specify how and when the syncs will run. For more information on the <strong>Basic</strong>, <strong>CRON</strong>, and <strong>Manual</strong> schedule types, refer to the <Link to="/reverse-etl/common-settings/sync-schedule-settings">Sync Schedule Settings</Link> guide.
</div>

2. After specifying the schedule type and run settings, click on **Continue** to finish the setup.

Databricks is now successfully configured as a source in your RudderStack dashboard. You can further connect this source to your preferred destination by clicking on **Add Destination** button, as shown:
