# Databricks

[Databricks](https://databricks.com/) provides a unified, open platform for all our data. It offers a simple collaborative environment to run interactive and scheduled data analysis workloads.

RudderStack supports Databricks as a source from which you can ingest data and route it to your desired downstream destinations.

## Setting up the Databricks source in RudderStack

To set up Databricks as a source in RudderStack, follow these steps:

### Naming the source

1. Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com).
2. From the left panel, go to **Source** > **New Source** > **Reverse ETL**. Then, select **Databricks**, as shown:

RudderStack lets you schedule data syncs for your Reverse ETL sources and specify how and when the syncs will run. For more information on the <strong>Basic</strong>, <strong>CRON</strong>, and <strong>Manual</strong> schedule types, refer to the <Link to="/reverse-etl/common-settings/sync-schedule-settings">Sync Schedule Settings</Link> guide.
