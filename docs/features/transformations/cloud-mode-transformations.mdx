description: Use transformations with cloud mode destinations.
---

When you <Link to="/features/transformations/#adding-a-transformation">add a transformation</Link> and connect it to a <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode">cloud mode</Link> destination, RudderStack does the following:

1. Tracks and collects events at the source.
2. Applies the transformation logic to the your events.
3. Forwards the transformed event to your connected destination.

## Applying transformation on a batch of events

You can perform any aggregation or roll-up operation on a batch of events using the `transformBatch` function instead of <Link to="/features/transformations/#transformevent-function">`transformEvent`</Link>, as shown:

```javascript
export function transformBatch(events, metadata) {
    return events;
}
```

<div class="dangerBlock">
To ensure event ordering when using the <code class="inline-code">transformBatch</code> function, make sure you pass the <code class="inline-code">messageId</code> from the input event to the output event. Without the <code class="inline-code">messageId</code>, RudderStack <strong>does not</strong> guarantee the event ordering. It is highly recommended to use <code class="inline-code">transformEvent</code> as much as possible, as it ensures event ordering.
</div>

## Debugging transformations

Once you <Link to="/features/transformations/#adding-a-transformation">add a transformation</Link>, you can capture any event-related information in the form of logs while running a test on your transformation. You can do this by including the `log` function in your transformation code. 

An example of using the `log` function is shown below:

```javascript
export function transformEvent(event, metadata) {
  const meta = metadata(event);
  event.sourceId = meta.sourceId;

  log("Event Name is", event.event, ";", "Message ID is", event.messageId);
  log("Source ID is", meta.sourceId);

  return event;
}
```

On adding the above transformation and clicking **Run Test**, you can see the resulting log in the **Logs** section of the dashboard, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/features/transformation-log.png" alt="Transformation log" />

<div class="infoBlock">
You can pass a string, number, or an object as an argument to the <code class="inline-code">log</code> function.
</div>

## Limitations

The transformation fails if the following memory and time limits are exceeded:

| Parameter    | Limit     |
| :----------- | :-------- |
| Memory limit | 128 MB      |
| Execution time limit   | 4 seconds |
