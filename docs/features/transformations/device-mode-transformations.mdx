## Limitations

The following memory and time limits are applicable when invoking a transformation in the device or cloud mode:

| Parameter    | Limit     |
| :----------- | :-------- |
| Memory limit | 128 MB      |
| Execution time limit   | 4 seconds |

<div class="dangerBlock">
The user transformation fails if these limits are exceeded.
</div>

Along with the above-mentioned limitations, the following are applicable when using a transformation in the device mode:

- Events are not sent to the destination SDKs in real-time.
- The network availability and server response can lead to latency while sending the events.
- The iOS SDK does not support background processing of an event when the app is closed. However, the backlog event is sent the next time the app is opened.
