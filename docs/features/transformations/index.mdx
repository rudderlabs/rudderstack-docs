description: Detailed technical documentation on RudderStack's Transformations feature.
---

RudderStack's **Transformations** feature enables you to write custom JavaScript functions to implement specific use-cases on your event data, such as:

- Filtering or sampling events
- Cleaning or aggregating data
- Data masking or removing sensitive PII to ensure data privacy
- Enriching events by implementing static logic or leveraging an external API
- Using an API to implement specific actions on the events

You can use this feature across your <Link to="/sources/event-streams/cloud-apps/">Cloud Apps</Link>, <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/">Reverse ETL</Link>, and <Link to="/sources/extract/">Cloud Extract</Link> pipelines.

Refer to our <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/sample-user-transformers">Sample RudderStack Transformations</a> repository for some useful templates that you can use to create your own transformations.
</div>

<div class="warningBlock">
The Transformations feature is supported while  sending events to destinations via both the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">device mode</Link> and <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode">cloud modes</Link>. However, only the  <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-android-sdk/">Android</Link>, <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-ios-sdk/">iOS</Link>, <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/">JavaScript</Link>, <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-react-native-sdk/">React-Native</Link>, and <Link to="/sources/event-streams/sdks/rudderstack-cordova-sdk/">Cordova</Link> SDKs are supported in the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">device mode</Link>.

## Key features

Some key features of RudderStack transformations are listed below:

- You can apply the transformations to your events in real-time.
- You can programmatically add and remove transformations using the <Link to="/api/transformation-api/">Transformations API</Link>.
- They're easier to build, manage, and debug, and reuse.
- You can create an organization-wide sandbox where your team can store the transformations before publishing them in a production environment.
- You can version control your transformations.

## How do transformations work?

At a high level, once you <Link to="#adding-a-transformation">add a transformation</Link> and connect it to a destination, RudderStack:

1. Tracks and collects events at the source
1. Applies the transformation logic to the your events
1. Forwards the transformed event to your connected destination

### Use case

Suppose you want to set the `context.os` field to `Android` for all the events, irrespective of the actual platform RudderStack tracks the event from. You can write a simple transformation to do this:

```javascript
export function transformEvent(event, metadata) {
    event.context.os = { name: "Android"};
    return event;
}
```

The `transformEvent` function overrides the event's `context.os.name` and sets it as `Android`, as seen below:

## Transformations in device mode

In case of mobile SDKs, RudderStack stores the events in the local DB before sending them for transformation. So if the transformation fails for any reason e.g., due to network unavailability we again try after some time. In this way, events will not be lost due to network issues.
    
- For Mobile SDKs only, users can easily revert to and from the SDK with the DMT feature.
- This feature will currently only be available for enterprise customers.
- Events can be filtered based on the integration options passed along with the event and/or [event filtering](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/sources/event-streams/sdks/event-filtering/) set in the RudderStack dashboard.
