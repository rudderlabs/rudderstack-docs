---

RudderStack's **Transformations** feature enables you to code custom JavaScript functions to implement specific use-cases on your event data, like:

- Filtering or sampling events
- Cleaning or aggregating data
- Data masking or removing sensitive PII information in the events to ensure data privacy
- Enriching events by implementing static logic or leveraging an external API
- Using an API to implement specific actions on the events

You can use this feature across your <Link to="/sources/cloud-apps/">Cloud Apps</Link>, <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/">Reverse ETL</Link>, and <Link to="/sources/extract/">Cloud Extract</Link> pipelines.

<div class="infoBlock">
Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/sample-user-transformers">Sample RudderStack Transformations</a> repository for some useful templates that you can use to create your own transformations.
</div>

<div class="warningBlock">
You can use the transformations only when sending events to the destinations via the <Link to="/destinations/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode">cloud mode</Link>.
</div>

## Key features

Some key features of RudderStack transformations are listed below:

- You can apply the transformations to your events in real-time.
- You can programmatically add and remove transformations using the <Link to="/api/transformation-api/">Transformations API</Link>.
- They're easier to build, manage, and debug, and reuse.
- You can create an organization-wide sandbox where your team can store the transformations before publishing them in a production environment.
- You can version control your transformations.

</div>

## How do transformations work?

At a high level, once you <Link to="#adding-a-transformation">add a transformation</Link> and connect it to a destination, RudderStack tracks and collects the events at the source (connected to the destination), applies the transformation logic to the events, and then forwards the transformed events to the destination.

</div>

### Use case

Suppose you want to set the `context.os` field to `Android` for all the events, irrespective of the actual platform RudderStack tracks the event from. You can write a simple transformation to do this:

```javascript
export function transformEvent(event, metadata) {
    event.context.os = { name: "Android"};
    return event;
}
```

The `transformEvent` function overrides the event's `context.os.name` and sets it as `Android`, as seen below:

<img src="../../assets/features/adding-a-transformation-3.png" alt="Transformation use-case" />

## Adding a transformation

To add a new transformation in the RudderStack dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Log into the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).
2. Go to **Enhance** > **Transformations**, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/features/adding-a-transformation-1.png" alt="Adding a Transformation" />

3. Click **New Transformation**.
4. Add a name for your transformation and an optional description.
5. Next, add your JavaScript function in the **Transformation** window, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/features/adding-a-transformation-2.png" alt="Adding a Transformation" />

<div class="successBlock">
You can also add other functions and call them from within <code class="inline-code">transformEvent</code>.
</div>

<div class="warningBlock">
Remember to delete the existing, pre-populated code within the <code class="inline-code">transformEvent</code> function before adding or pasting your transformation code.
</div>

6. To test your transformation, paste your sample event in the **Events** block and click **Run Test**. By default, RudderStack provides some sample events to test if your transformation logic works as expected.

<img src="../../assets/features/adding-a-transformation-3.png" alt="Adding a Transformation" />

7. To save the transformation, click **Save**.

### Debugging with logs

RudderStack enables you to capture any event-related information in the form of logs while running a test on your transformation. You can do this by including the `log` function in your transformation code. 

An example of using the `log` function is shown below:

```javascript
export function transformEvent(event, metadata) {
  const meta = metadata(event);
  event.sourceId = meta.sourceId;

  log("Event Name is", event.event, ";", "Message ID is", event.messageId);
  log("Source ID is", meta.sourceId);

  return event;
}
```

On adding the above transformation and clicking **Run Test**, you can see the resulting log in the **Logs** section of the dashboard, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/features/transformation-log.png" alt="Transformation log" />

<div class="infoBlock">
You can pass a string, number, or an object as an argument to the <code class="inline-code">log</code> function.
</div>

## Connecting transformation to a destination

You can connect a transformation to a destination in two cases:

### Case 1: While setting up a new destination

RudderStack provides the option to connect an existing transformation or create a new transformation while setting up a destination, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/features/connecting-a-transformation.png" alt="Connecting a transformation" />

### Case 2: While connecting to an existing destination

To add a transformation to an existing destination, follow these steps:

1. In the dashboard, go to the **Transformation** tab in your destination dashboard and click **Add a transformation**, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/features/adding-transformation-existing-destination-1.png" alt="Connecting a transformation to existing destination" />

2. Then, choose the transformation to connect to the destination.

<img src="../../assets/features/adding-transformation-existing-destination-2.png" alt="Connecting a transformation to existing destination" />

## Deleting a transformation

To delete a transformation, go to **Enhance** > **Transformations** and click the **Delete** button next to the transformation that you want to delete, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/features/deleting-a-transformation.png" alt="Deleting a transformation" />

<div class="warningBlock">
You cannot delete a transformation that is connected to a destination.
</div>

## `transformEvent` function

While using a transformation, RudderStack applies the `transformEvent` function on each event that takes two arguments:
- `event`: Corresponds to the input event.
- `metadata` (optional): Corresponds to the JavaScript function which you can use to access the metadata of the given event.

<div class="infoBlock">
For more information on <code class="inline-code">metadata</code>, refer to the <Link to="#accessing--the-event-metadata">Accessing metadata</Link> section below.
</div>

After the transformation is complete, `transformEvent` returns the final event to be sent to the destination.

## Accessing event metadata

RudderStack injects a function `metadata(event)` into your transformations as an argument. This allows you to access the event metadata variables that help you customize your transformations.

<div class="infoBlock">
<code class="inline-code">metadata()</code> takes the event as the input and returns the metadata of the event.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">
Since you may not need the event metadata in every transformation, it is an <strong>optional argument</strong> and can be skipped.
</div>

The following properties, if available, are present in the metadata response:

| Property   | Description       |
| :-------------- | :------------------------- |
| `sourceId`      | The source ID in the **Settings** tab of your configured source in the dashboard. |
| `destinationId` | The destination ID in the **Settings** tab of your configured destination in the dashboard.           |
| `messageId`     | The unique ID for each event.            |

An example of using `metadata` is shown below:

```javascript
export function transformEvent(event, metadata) {
  const meta = metadata(event);
  event.sourceId = meta.sourceId;

  return event;
}
```

## Applying transformation on a batch of events

You can also perform any aggregation or roll-up operation on a batch of events using the `transformBatch` function instead of `transformEvent`, as shown:

```javascript
export function transformBatch(events, metadata) {
    return events;
}
```

<div class="dangerBlock">
If you want to ensure event ordering while using <code class="inline-code">transformBatch</code>, make sure you pass the <code class="inline-code">messageId</code> from the input event to the output event. Without the <code class="inline-code">messageId</code>, RudderStack will <strong>not</strong> guarantee the event ordering. It is highly recommended to use <code class="inline-code">transformEvent</code> as much as possible, as it ensures event ordering.
</div>

## Libraries

One of the key features of RudderStack transformations is the ability to reuse the transformation code in other transformations using the **Libraries** feature.

### Adding a library

To add a new library, follow these steps:

1. In the [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), go to **Enhance** > **Transformations** and click the **Libraries** tab, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/features/adding-a-library-1.png" alt="Adding a library" />

2. Click **New library**.
3. Add the library **Name**, **Description** and write the function you want to reuse across different transformations. You can also add multiple functions in a single library, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/features/adding-a-library-2.png" alt="Adding a library" />

4. Click **Run Test** to ensure the library code has the correct syntax.

### Using libraries in transformations

To use the libraries in your existing transformations, refer to the **Import Library Name** option in the RudderStack dashboard, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/features/libraries-in-transformations.png" alt="Using libraries in transformations" />

<div class="infoBlock">
RudderStack converts the library name into <strong>camel case without spaces</strong>; this becomes your <strong>library handle</strong> which you can use across multiple transformations. For example, if your library name is <code class="inline-code">Sample Transformation Library</code>, then the library handle would be <code class="inline-code">sampleTransformationLibrary</code>.
</div>

You can then use the library in a transformation with a simple `import` statement. Refer to the below use case for more information.

#### Use case

Suppose you want to import a function `rudderEmail` from the `Is Rudder Email` library to filter events that don't have the email address containing the RudderStack domain.

The `rudderEmail` function is as follows:

```javascript
export function rudderEmail(email) {
    return /@(rudderlabs|rudderstack)| \+ruddertest/.test(email);
}
```

The following code snippet demonstrates how you can implement this in a transformation:

```javascript
import { rudderEmail } from "isRudderEmail";
export function transformEvent(event) {
  const email =
    event.context && event.context.traits && event.context.traits.email;
  if (email) {
    if (!rudderEmail(email)) return;
  }
  return event;
}
```

On clicking **Run Test**, a sample event not containing the RudderStack email domain is filtered out, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/features/libraries-in-transformations-test.png" alt="Filtering out events using libraries in transformation" />

### Importing multiple functions from a single library

The following snippets highlight how to properly import functions from a library:

```javascript
// ---------------
import { getLoss } from "getFinanceData";

// OR

import { getLoss, getRevenue, getProfit } from "getFinanceData";
import {
  getLoss,
  getRevenue,
  getProfit
} from "getFinanceData";

// For default getPrice import
import getPrice, { getRevenue, getProfit } from "getFinanceData";

// alias imports
import getPrice as gp, { getRevenue as gr, getProfit } from "getFinanceData";
// usage: gp(event), gr(event), getProfit(ev)

import * as GFD from "getFinanceData";
// usage: GFD.getRevenue(ev), GFD.getProfit(ev)
// for default import: GFD.default(ev)
```

The following snippets highlight the **incorrect** way of importing the library functions:

```javascript
// -----------------
import * from "getFinanceData";
getPrice(ev)

// OR

import getPrice as gp from "getFinanceData";
getPrice(ev)
```

### Deleting a library

To delete a transformation, go to **Enhance** > **Transformations** and click the **Libraries** tab. button next to the transformation that you want to delete, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/features/deleting-a-library.png" alt="Deleting a library" />

<div class="warningBlock">
You cannot delete a <Link to="/features/transformations/faq#what-is-a-referenced-library">referenced library</Link>.
</div>

## Making external API requests

You can make any number of external API requests in your transformation functions and use the response to enrich your events. 

RudderStack injects an asynchronous `fetch` function in your transformations. It makes an API call to the given URL and returns the response in the JSON format.

You can use the `fetch` function in your transformations, as shown:

```javascript
export async function transformEvent(event, metadata) {
  const res = await fetch("post_url", {
    method: "POST",  // POST, PUT, DELETE, GET, etc.
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json;charset=UTF-8",
      Authorization: "Bearer <authorization_token>"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(event)
  });
  event.response = JSON.stringify(res);
  return event;
}
```

<div class="infoBlock">
To see the <code class="inline-code">fetch</code> function in action, refer to the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/sample-user-transformers/blob/sampleTransformationV1/EnrichWithClearbit.js">Clearbit enrichment</a> sample transformation.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">
For improved performance, it is highly recommended to use the <code class="inline-code">batch</code> API requests instead of a separate API request for each event wherever possible.
</div>

### Fetching response properties using `fetchV2`

**FetchV2** is a wrapper for the `fetch` call. It enables you to fetch the response properties more efficiently while making the external API calls.

The following properties are present in a `fetchV2` response:

| Property | Description  |
| :-------------- | :----------- |
| `status`      | Status code of fetch response, for example, `200`. |
| `url` | The URL of the Fetch API.   |
| `headers`     | The response headers   |
| `body`     | The response body in JSON or TEXT. By default, it is JSON. |

The below example highlights the use of the `fetchV2` function in a transformation to capture failure due to a timeout: 
  
```javascript
export async function transformEvent(event) {
  try {
    const res = await fetchV2("url", { timeout: 1000});
    if (res.status == 200) {
      event.response = JSON.stringify(res.body);
    }
  } catch (err) {
    log(err.message);
  }
  return event;
}
```

## Limits

You should take into account the following memory and time limits when invoking a transformation:

| Parameter    | Limit     |
| :----------- | :-------- |
| Memory limit | 128 MB      |
| Execution time limit   | 4 seconds |

<div class="dangerBlock">
The user transformation fails if these limits are exceeded.
</div>
