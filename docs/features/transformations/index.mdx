description: Detailed technical documentation on RudderStack's Transformations feature.
---

RudderStack's **Transformations** feature enables you to write custom JavaScript functions to implement specific use-cases on your event data, such as:

- Filtering or sampling events
- Cleaning or aggregating data
- Data masking or removing sensitive PII to ensure data privacy
- Enriching events by implementing static logic or leveraging an external API
- Using an API to implement specific actions on the events

You can use this feature across your <Link to="/sources/event-streams/">Event Streams</Link>, <Link to="/sources/extract/">Cloud Extract</Link>, and <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/">Reverse ETL</Link> pipelines.

## Key features

Some key features of RudderStack Transformations are listed below:

- You can apply the Transformations to your events in real-time.
- You can programmatically add and remove Transformations using the <Link to="/api/transformation-api/">Transformations API</Link>.
- They're easier to build, manage, and debug, and reuse.
- You can create an organization-wide sandbox where your team can store the Transformations before publishing them in a production environment.
- You can version control your Transformations.

## How do Transformations work?

At a high level, once you <Link to="/features/transformations/using-transformations#adding-a-transformation">add a Transformation</Link> and connect it to a destination, RudderStack:

1. Tracks and collects events at the source.
2. Applies the transformation logic to the your events.
3. Forwards the transformed event to your connected destination.

Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/sample-user-transformers">Sample RudderStack Transformations</a> repository for some useful templates that you can use to create your own transformations.

## Use case

Suppose you want to set the `context.os` field to `Android` for all the events, irrespective of the actual platform RudderStack tracks the event from. You can write a simple transformation to do this:

```javascript
export function transformEvent(event, metadata) {
    event.context.os = { name: "Android"};
    return event;
}
```

The `transformEvent` function overrides the event's `context.os.name` and sets it as `Android`, as seen below:
