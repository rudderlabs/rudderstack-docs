description: Detailed technical documentation on RudderStack's Transformations feature.
---

Transformations is one of RudderStack's key features. It gives you the ability to code custom JavaScript functions to implement specific use-cases on your event data, like:

- Filtering/sampling events.
- Enriching events by implementing static logic or leveraging an external API.
- Cleaning/aggregating data.
- Data masking or removing sensitive PII information in the events to ensure data privacy.
- Implementing external actions on the events using an API.

## Adding a transformation

- Log into your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/).
- Click on the [**Transformations**](https://app.rudderstack.com/transformations) link from the left panel in the dashboard, as shown:

<img src="../assets/image (90).png" alt="Adding a Transformation" />

- Click on the **Create New** option as shown:

<img src="../assets/image (92).png" alt="Create New Transformation" />

- Next, assign a name for this new transformation. Enter the transformation function's code in the **Transformation** window, as shown:

<img
  src="../assets/image (100).png"
  alt="Assign a transformation name"
/>

- Add your transformation code within the `transformEvent` function in the **Transformation** window. You can also add other functions and call them from within `transformEvent`.

<img src="../assets/image (99).png" alt="transformEvent function" />

<div class="infoBlock">
Our <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/sample-user-transformers">Transformations</a> GitHub repository contains some useful templates that you can use to create your own transformations.

You can copy-paste the entire code of any of the functions present in this repository into the **Transformation** window.

</div>

<div class="warningBlock">
Remember to delete the pre-populated <code class="inline-code">transformEvent</code> function in such cases, before pasting your code.
</div>

- RudderStack also gives you the ability to test your transformation function with the **Run Test** option as shown:

<img src="../assets/image (97).png" alt="Run Test" />

- In case you want to perform any aggregation/roll-up operation on a micro batch of events, use the `transformBatch` function, as shown:

```javascript
export function transformBatch(events, metadata) {
    return events;
}
```

<div class="dangerBlock">
Disclaimer for using <code class="inline-code">transformBatch</code>:

<ul>
<li>Make sure you pass on the <code class="inline-code">messageId</code> from the input event onto the output event. If the <code class="inline-code">messageId</code> is passed on, the order of delivery of events is preserved. <strong>Without it, this order may not be maintained</strong>.</li>
<li>It is highly recommended to use <code class="inline-code">transformEvent</code> in every possible case as it ensures event ordering in all cases.</li>
<li>In case a <code class="inline-code">transformBatch</code> is required and event ordering is important, make sure to pass on the <code class="inline-code">messageId</code>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Libraries

One of the key features of RudderStack Transformations is the ability to reuse code written for a transformation in other transformations as well. For this, RudderStack lets you create libraries or functions that can be reused in different transformations.

To create a library, follow these steps:

- Click on the [**Transformations**](https://app.rudderstack.com/transformations) link in the left nav bar and go to the **Libraries** section. Click on the **Create New** option to add new libraries, as shown:

<img src="../assets/image (89).png" alt="Create new library" />

- Add the library's **Name**, an optional **Description**, and include the custom functions that you need to reuse across all other transformations.

<img
  src="../assets/image (91).png"
  alt="Add library name and description"
/>

- You can add multiple functions to a single library, as shown:

<img
  src="../assets/image (95).png"
  alt="Add more functions under a single library"
/>

<div class="warningBlock">
RudderStack does not support the deletion of libraries as of now. This is to ensure that you don't break any existing transformations that use the library that you might be trying to delete.
</div>

## Using libraries in transformations

To use the libraries in your existing transformation, simply take the name of your library and convert it into **camel case without spaces** - this becomes your library handle.

For example, if your library name is **`is rudder email`**, then the library handle would be **`isRudderEmail`**.

<img src="../assets/image (101).png" alt="Using libraries in transformations" />

Let's say you want to import a function called **`rudderEmail`**, which returns `true` for the emails from a specific domain \(e.g. RudderStack\) and `false` otherwise, from the **`is rudder email`** library. Also, you want to use this function to filter the events that don't have the email address of the specified domain.

The following code snippet demonstrates how we can implement this use-case:

```javascript
import { rudderEmail } from "isRudderEmail";
export function transformEvent(event) {
  const email =
    event.context && event.context.traits && event.context.traits.email;
  if (email) {
    if (!rudderEmail(email)) return;
  }
  return event;
}
```

On running a test, an example event not having the specified email domain is filtered out, as shown:

<img src="../assets/image (86).png" alt="Event filtered out without specifying email domain" />

### Importing multiple functions from a single library

When importing a single function or multiple functions from a library, it is important to keep the import statement to one line. Breaking the import function into multiple lines will lead to an error.

The following snippets highlight how to properly import functions from a library:

```javascript
// Correct Way
// ---------------
import { getLoss } from "getFinanceData";

// OR

import { getLoss, getRevenue, getProfit } from "getFinanceData";
import {
  getLoss,
  getRevenue,
  getProfit
} from "getFinanceData";

// For default getPrice import
import getPrice, { getRevenue, getProfit } from "getFinanceData";

// alias imports
import getPrice as gp, { getRevenue as gr, getProfit } from "getFinanceData";
// usuage: gp(event), gr(event), getProfit(ev)

import * as GFD from "getFinanceData";
// usuage: GFD.getRevenue(ev), GFD.getProfit(ev)
// for default import: GFD.default(ev)
```

```javascript
// Incorrect Way
// -----------------
import * from "getFinanceData";

// OR

import getPrice as gp from "getFinanceData";
getPrice(ev)
```

## Accessing metadata

RudderStack injects a function `metadata(event)` into your transformations as an argument. This allows you to access the event metadata variables that help you customize your transformations.

<div class="infoBlock">

<code class="inline-code">metadata()</code> takes the event as input and returns the metadata of the event.
</div>

The following properties, if available, are present in the metadata response:

| Property Name   | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sourceId`      | This refers to the ID of the source configured on your RudderStack dashboard. Note that it different from the source **Write Key**. Refer to the image below for more details. |
| `destinationId` | ID of the destination configured on your RudderStack dashboard.                                                                                                                |
| `messageId`     | Corresponds to the unique ID for each event.                                                                                                                                   |
| `sessionId`     | If sessions are enabled, this corresponds to the value of the session ID.                                                                                                      |

<img src="../assets/image (98).png" alt="Source ID" />

<img src="../assets/image (120) (1) (1).png" alt="Source ID" />

Since you may not need the metadata in every transformation, you can optionally access it by including it in your function signature as an argument wherever required.

An example of this is as shown below:

```javascript
export function transformEvent(event, metadata) {
  const meta = metadata(event);
  event.sourceId = meta.sourceId;

  return event;
}
```

## External API requests

You can make any number of external API requests in your transformation functions and use the response to enrich your events data. RudderStack injects an asynchronous `fetch(url)` function into your transformations. It makes an API call to the given URL and returns the response in a JSON format.

An example of how to use the `fetch` function in transformations is shown below:

```javascript
export async function transformEvent(event, metadata) {
  const res = await fetch("post_url", {
    method: "POST", // POST, PUT, DELETE, GET, etc.
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json;charset=UTF-8",
      Authorization: "Bearer <your_authorization_token>"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(event)
  });
  event.response = JSON.stringify(res);
  return event;
}
```

<div class="successBlock">
To see how this feature is used in more detail, refer to the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/sample-user-transformers/blob/sampleTransformationV1/EnrichWithClearbit.js">Clearbit enrichment example</a> which uses the <code class="inline-code">fetch</code> function.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">
For improved performance, we recommend using <code class="inline-code">batch</code> API requests instead of a separate API request for each event whenever possible.
</div>

### FetchV2

FetchV2 is a wrapper around the `fetch` call to provide more access to fetch the response properties.

The following properties are present in a `fetchV2` response:

| Property Name   | Description  |
| :-------------- | :----------- |
| `status`      | Status code of fetch response, e.g. `200`.|
| `url` | URL of the Fetch API.   |
| `headers`     | Response headers   |
| `body`     | Response body in JSON or TEXT. By default, it is JSON. |

<div class="infoBlock">
Use the <code class="inline-code">try-catch</code> block to capture the cause for failures during the <code class="inline-code">fetch</code> call, e.g. when a timeout is applied.
</div>

An example of how to use the `fetchV2` function in RudderStack transformations is shown below:
  
```javascript
export async function transformEvent(event) {
  try {
    const res = await fetchV2("url", { timeout: 1000});
    if (res.status == 200) {
      event.response = JSON.stringify(res.body);
    }
  } catch (err) {
    log(err.message);
  }
  return event;
}
```
  
## Debugging with logs

You can access event-related logs while running a test by including the `log()` function in your transformation code. An example of this is as shown:

```javascript
export function transformEvent(event, metadata) {
  const meta = metadata(event);
  event.sourceId = meta.sourceId;

  log("Event Name is", event.event, ";", "Message Id is", event.messageId);
  log("Source Id is", meta.sourceId);

  return event;
}
```

On running a test on the above code, you can see the logs in the **Logs** section of the dashboard, as shown:

<img
  src="../assets/image (103) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (1) (2) (2) (2) (2) (1).png"
  alt="Adding a Transformation"
/>

<div class="infoBlock">
Arguments to the <code class="inline-code">log</code> function can be a String, Number or Object.
</div>

## Limits

You should take into account the memory and time limits when adding a new transformation. Each invocation of the transformation should not exceed the following limits:

| Parameter    | Limit     |
| :----------- | :-------- |
| Memory Limit | 8 MB      |
| Time Limit   | 4 seconds |

<div class="warningBlock">
The user transformation fails if these limits are exceeded.
</div>

## FAQ

## Why do I need to use RudderStack's Transformations feature?

RudderStack's Transformations feature lets you transform the events collected from a source into a destination-specific format. Some key benefits of this feature are:

- These transformations can be applied to your in-transit events, in real-time.
- You can implement specific use-cases depending on your business requirements using this feature. Some examples include PII masking, event filtering based on specific criteria, aggregating and enriching events, and so on.
- They're easier to build and manage, and can be reused as well.

</div>

## I used to write transformations like `function transform(events) {}`. Why am I not able to create new transformations this way?

We have changed the way transformations are written. RudderStack now supports writing functions that transform a single event instead of a batch of events. You can now define your transformation in the following manner:

`export function transformEvent(event, metadata) {}`

## I want to write a transformation that can be applied to a small batch of events. Can I not do this anymore?

You can. Simply define your transformation in the following manner:

`export function transformBatch(events, metadata) {}`

<div class="warningBlock">
This can cause a loss of the event metadata that RudderStack uses internally to maintain event ordering for you.
</div>

## I cannot import libraries into my existing transformations. What do I do?

Previously created transformations shown as `Version: V0` don't support libraries. If you want to use libraries, please create a new transformation with `Version: V1` that support libraries. You can then reconnect your destinations with this new transformation that you have created.

## I want to update my existing version v0 transformation code to version v1. What do I do?

You cannot update transformation `Version: V0` directly to `Version: V1`. Please create a new transformation with updated code `Version: V1`. You can then reconnect your destinations with this new transformation that you have created and delete existing `Version: V0` transformation.
