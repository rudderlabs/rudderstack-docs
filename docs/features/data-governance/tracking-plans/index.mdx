  Detailed technical description of the Tracking Plans feature to plan and monitor your event data.

Tracking Plans let you proactively monitor and act on non-compliant event data coming into your RudderStack sources based on predefined plans. This can help you prevent or de-risk situations where missing or improperly configured event data can break your downstream destinations.

## Tracking Plan features

With the help of a Tracking Plan, you can:

* Define specific event names and properties for your `track` calls.
* Specify whether a property/attribute is required and assign a particular data type.
* Have better control of your data streaming by supporting a versioning system.
* Use the <Link to="/api/data-governance-api/">Data Governance API</Link> to evaluate your inbound events and metadata, and compare them with your plans.

## FAQ

### Which calls are supported by the tracking plans?

The Tracking Plans feature currently supports only <Link to="/event-spec/standard-events/track/">`track`</Link> events.

### Does RudderStack propagate the context related to any tracking plan violations?

Currently, RudderStack propagates any context related to the tracking plan violations **only to theÂ data warehouses** but not all the destinations. You can use this context in your <Link to="/transformations">Transformations</Link> for filtering or modifying the events before they reach the destination.

If you have defined the <Link to="/features/data-governance/tracking-plans/tracking-plan-spreadsheet/#global-settings">tracking plan global settings</Link> such that **Allow unplanned events** is set to `FALSE`, the events that are explicitly dropped via the tracking plan will not reach any destination.
