# Customer.io

[**Customer.io**](https://customer.io/) is a popular marketing platform for sending targeted emails and push and SMS notifications to improve customer engagement and thereby the overall conversion rate. It leverages real-time behavioral data and advanced segmentation techniques across the web and mobile platforms to improve your customers' overall experience.

By adding a reporting webhook in Customer.io, you can send your Customer.io email events to RudderStack. These include events such as email delivered, opened, bounced, and more.

This guide will help you set up Customer.io as a source in RudderStack.

## Getting started

Follow these steps to set up your Customer.io source in the RudderStack dashboard:

- Go to your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/) and click on **Add Source**. Then, select **CustomerIO** from the list of **Event Stream** sources, as shown:

<img src="../assets/event-stream-sources/customerio-1.png" alt="Customer.io source in RudderStack" />

- Assign a source name and click on **Next**.

<div class="warningBlock">

To connect this source to a RudderStack warehouse destination, the source name should match the name of your warehouse schema.
</div>

- Your Customer.io source is now configured. Note the source **Write key** - this will be required to configure the endpoint URL in the following steps.

<img src="../assets/event-stream-sources/customerio-2.png" alt="Customer.io source write key" />

- Head over to your Customer.io account and navigate to the **Integrations** page from the sidebar. Then, look for the integration **Reporting Webhooks**, as shown:

<img src="../assets/event-stream-sources/customerio-3.png" alt="Customer.io reporting webhooks" />

- Click on **Add Webhook** and add the webhook URL as shown on the source settings page in your RudderStack dashboard.

<img src="../assets/event-stream-sources/customerio-4.png" alt="Customer.io webhook URL" />

The webhook URL is of the format:

```
<DATA_PLANE_URL>/v1/webhook?writeKey=<WRITE_KEY>
```

A sample webhook URL is shown below:

```
https://hosted.rudderlabs.com/v1/webhook?writeKey=1bCenS7ynqHh8ETX8s5Crjh22J
```

<div class="infoBlock">
 
 Refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-open-source/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack/#what-is-a-data-plane-url-where-do-i-get-it">data plane URL</a> section for more information.
</div>

<div class="warningBlock">

Make sure you add the source write key as query parameter to the URL. This is required to prevent the webhook from failing because of an invalid write key.
</div>

- Finally, save the webhook.
