# Flushing Events

The Android SDK supports the `flush()` API. It retrieves all the messages present in the database, divides them into individual batches based on the specified queue size, and flushes them to the RudderStack server/backend.

For example, if the `flushQueueSize` is 30 and there are 180 events in the database advanced the `flush()` API is called, the Android SDK will retrieve all those events and divide them into batches of 30 messages each, that is, total 6 batches. 

If a batch fails for some reason, the remaining batches are dropped as well to maintain the sequence of the messages. A batch is considered as failed if it isn’t sent to the server even after 3 retries. 

In the device mode, the `flush()` API also calls the destination SDK’s `flush()` API (if exists).  
 

## Flushing Events Periodically

RudderStack supports periodic flushing of events from the Android SDK to RudderStack, irrespective of whether your app is opened or not. This ensures that the events that are triggered just before closing the app are sent from the device - even if the app is not opened by the user for a long time.

To use this feature, follow these steps:

1. Open your `app/build.gradle` and add the [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/work) dependency under `dependencies` as shown below:

```groovy
implementation 'androidx.work:work-runtime:2.7.1'
```

2. Use `withFlushPeriodically()` function while passing the `RudderConfig` object to the `getInstance()` API, as shown below:

```kotlin
rudderClient = RudderClient.getInstance(
  this,
  <WRITE_KEY>,
  RudderConfig.Builder()
  .withDataPlaneUrl(<DATA_PLANE_URL>)
  // enabling periodical flush of events in the DB with a repeat interval of 15 minutes
  .withFlushPeriodically(15, TimeUnit.MINUTES)
  .build()
)
```
### `withFlushPeriodically` parameters

The `withFlushPeriodically` function takes two parameters:

* The first parameter is the number representing the time interval for the flushing to be repeated.
* The second parameter is the time unit of the repeat interval. It can be **Minutes**, **Hours**, or **Days**. The minimum value of the repeat interval is **15 minutes**.

## Initializing WorkManager on demand

By default, the WorkManager is initialized on the startup of the application. However, you can initialize it only on demand by following the below steps:

1. Add the below `provider` to the application tag of your application’s `AndroidManifest.xml`.

```xml
<provider
    android:name="androidx.startup.InitializationProvider"
    android:authorities="${applicationId}.androidx-startup"
    android:exported="false"
    tools:node="merge">
    <!-- If you are using androidx.startup to initialize other components -->
    <meta-data
        android:name="androidx.work.WorkManagerInitializer"
        android:value="androidx.startup"
        tools:node="remove" />
 </provider>
 ```

2. Implement `Configuration.Provider` and define the function `getWorkManagerConfiguration()` in your application class as shown below:

```kotlin
class MyApplication(): Application(), Configuration.Provider {

  override fun getWorkManagerConfiguration() =
    Configuration.Builder()
    .setMinimumLoggingLevel(android.util.Log.INFO)
    .build()
}
```
