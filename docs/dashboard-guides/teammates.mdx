## User permissions

An invited user can be assigned any of the following three roles:

### Read-only

This user role has the following permissions:

| Option       | View | Add | Modify | Delete |
| :----------- | :--- | :-- | :----- | :----- |
| [Sources](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/sources/)     | Yes  | No  | No     | No     |
| [Destinations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/destinations/) | Yes  | No  | No     | No     |

| [Transformations](https://rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/) | Yes  | No  | No     | No     |

Some things to note regarding the read-only user permissions:
- Read-only users can view the settings of all the destinations. However, secrets like access keys are hidden from them.
- They can run tests on existing transformations but they cannot add, modify, or delete transformations.
- They can also view any secrets, like API keys in the transformation code.
