To consume all the public RudderStack APIs, you need an access token associated with your RudderStack account. This guide describes the steps to generate a **personal access token** and the operations associated with it.

<div class="warningBlock">
You can create and use the personal access tokens with the permissions specific to your role type. For example, <Link to="/dashboard-guides/user-management/#read-only">Read-only</Link> users can create access tokens with only read-only privileges, <Link to="/dashboard-guides/user-management/#read-write">Read-Write</Link> users with read-only and read-write privileges, and <Link to="/dashboard-guides/user-management/#admin">Admin</Link> users with all the privileges.
</div>
