Once you [sign up](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup) for RudderStack Cloud, you are presented with a dashboard that lets you set up and manage all your event data sources, destinations, and connections through an easy-to-use UI.

This guide walks you through all the dashboard options to get started with RudderStack Cloud in no time.

## Get Started

This option helps you easily get started with RudderStack. You can set up a source and connect it to your cloud destinations or data warehouses via this page, as shown:

## Directory

**Directory** acts as a catalogue for all the sources (<Link to="/sources/cloud-apps/">Cloud Apps</Link>, <Link to="/sources/extract/">Cloud Extract</Link> and <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/">Reverse ETL</Link>) and destinations (<Link to="/destinations/warehouse-destinations/">Warehouse</Link> and <Link to="/destinations/streaming-destinations/">Streaming destinations</Link>) supported by RudderStack.

## Connections

This option lets you set up your data pipelines by connecting different sources and destinations across your entire customer data stack.

### Data plane URL

For routing and processing the events to the RudderStack backend, a **data plane URL** is required.

</div>

Here's how to get the Data Plane URL:

* If you're using [RudderStack Cloud Free](https://app.rudderlabs.com/signup?type=freetrial), the data plane URL is provided in the dashboard itself. 
* If you're using [RudderStack Pro or Enterprise](https://rudderstack.com/pricing), [contact us](https://rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack-community) for the data plane URL with the email ID you used to sign up for RudderStack.
* If you're using [RudderStack Open Source](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup?type=opensource), you are required to <Link to="/get-started/rudderstack-open-source/data-plane-setup/">set up your own data plane</Link> in your preferred environment.
