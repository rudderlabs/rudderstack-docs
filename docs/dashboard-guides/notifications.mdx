RudderStack's notifications feature lets you enable data delivery alerts for sources, cloud destinations, and warehouse destinations. You can  subscribe/unsubscribe to alerts for a particular resource once your admin enables the alerts for that resource.

## Enable notifications

To enable the alerting service for a particular source or destination you must have <Link to="/dashboard-guides/user-management/#role-permissions">admin permissions</Link>.

1. Navigate to your desired source or destination in the RudderStack dashboard.
2. Click the **Settings** tab.
3. Toggle the switch in the **Enable Notifications** section to allow members to subscribe to notifications for the selected source/destination.

## Manage alerts

To manage the individual alerts per connection, navigate to the **Settings** menu in the main left-hand navigation and click the *Notifications* tab.

In the notifications area, you can manage your alert subscriptions for errors relating to sources, cloud destinations, and warehouse destinations. Notifications must have been enabled by an admin as described in the <Link to="#enable-notifications-per-connection">previous section</Link>.

From the **Notifications** tab, click the **Manage Subscription** button to toggle on/off subscriptions to all of the sources, destinations, and warehouse destinations your admin has enabled.

From this view you can toggle your own notifications on or off. Clicking the arrow will take you to the Settings page for that connection.
