RudderStack's notifications feature lets you enable data delivery alerts for sources, cloud destinations, and warehouse destinations. You can  subscribe/unsubscribe to alerts for a particular resource once your admin enables the alerts for that resource.

## Enabling notifications

To enable the alerting service for a particular source or destination you must have <Link to="/dashboard-guides/user-management/#role-permissions">admin permissions</Link>.

1. Navigate to your desired source or destination in the RudderStack dashboard.
2. Click the **Settings** tab.
3. Toggle the switch in the **Enable Notifications** section to allow members to subscribe to notifications for the selected source/destination.

<div class="infoBlock">
The <strong>Enable Notifications</strong> option is only available to users with admin privileges.
</div>

## Managing alerts

To manage the individual alerts per connection, navigate to the **Settings** menu in the main left-hand navigation and click the *Notifications* tab.

In the notifications area, you can manage your alert subscriptions for errors relating to sources, cloud destinations, and warehouse destinations. Notifications must have been enabled by an admin as described in the <Link to="#enable-notifications-per-connection">previous section</Link>.

From the **Notifications** tab, click the **Manage Subscription** button to toggle on/off subscriptions to all of the sources, destinations, and warehouse destinations your admin has enabled.

From this view you can toggle your own notifications on or off. Clicking the arrow will take you to the Settings page for that connection.

## Alert types

RudderStack will send email alerts for two types of errors: datatype mismatch and delivery errors. In addition, it also sends some delivery warning alerts.

Refer to the following tables for the error descriptions/warnings and the necessary actions to resolve them.

### Datatype mismatch errors

|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Message format type not supported.                     | The destination does not support this message type. Ensure that you pass only the supported event type.                              |
| Invalid payload for the destination.                   | The inputted JSON payload does not match the expected request body.                                                                               |

| Event timestamp should be within last `<timeline>`.      | The event needs to be within the last `<timeline>` for successful delivery of the event. Any event older than `<timeline>` would result in failures.  |

### Delivery warnings

| Warning          | Customer actions                    |
| :--------------| :-----------------------------|
| You're reaching the column limit in your `<table_name>` table. | Use any of the following approaches: <br /> <ul><li>Go to your warehouse and delete (drop) the unwanted table columns. </li> <li>If you're syncing semi-structured event data that is not defined by a fixed schema, you can leverage RudderStack's <Link to="/destinations/warehouse-destinations/json-column-support/">JSON Column Support</Link> feature to send your data.</li></ul> <br />For more information, refer to the <Link to="/destinations/warehouse-destinations/faq/#how-can-i-handle-the-column-count-threshold-in-my-warehouse">Warehouse FAQ</Link> guide. |
| Warehouse column names are not matching the destination views as the views are outdated. Recreate your views so that they point to the latest column names and then drop the older columns. Please use the queries in the documentation to drop the columns. | Your deprecated columns will be of the format `<column-name>-deprecated-<uuid>`. Follow these steps: <br /> <ol><li>Find the `<table>` and the `<column>` by querying your metadata tables. Ignore the columns that have the deprecated column format already. For example, in case of Redshift, your query will something like: <br /><br /> `select table_name, column_name from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where table_schema = '<schema>' and column_name like '%-deprecated-%';` </li><br /><li>Once you find the `<table>` and the `<column>`, drop the columns. A sample Redshift query is shown below: <br /><br /> `ALTER TABLE <table> DROP COLUMN "<column>" CASCADE;` </li><br /><li>Finally, recreate your views. A sample Redshift query is shown below: <br /><br /> `CREATE VIEW <table-view> AS SELECT * FROM <table>;` </li></ol>  |
