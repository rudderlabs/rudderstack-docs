  Detailed guide on working with sources in RudderStack Cloud.
---

A **source** is a platform or an application (web, mobile, server-side, or a third-party cloud app) from where RudderStack tracks and collects the event data.

<div class="infoBlock">
You can configure a source for every unique source of data. You can also create multiple sources for each website or application from where you want to track the data.
</div>

The **Sources** option is provided in the left navigation bar in the RudderStack dashboard. It lets you view all your configured sources, as shown:

<div class="infoBlock">
RudderStack classifies the sources into following
  categories:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <Link to="/sources/cloud-apps/">Event Stream</Link>
    </li>
    <li>
      <Link to="/sources/extract/">Cloud Extract</Link>
    </li>
    <li>

<div class="infoBlock">

</div>

<div class="warningBlock">
Setting up <Link to="/sources/extract/">Cloud Extract</Link> or <Link to="/sources/reverse-etl/">Reverse ETL</Link> sources require some additional configuration. Refer to the relevant source-specific documentation for details.
</div>

  - **Enabled**: Lets you enable or disable syncing data from this source.
  - **Source ID**: Unique identifier associated with your source.
  - **Permanently delete source**: Lets you delete a source by clicking on the **Delete** button.

<div class="warningBlock">

</div>

## FAQ

### What is a write key? Why is it required?

The write key (also referred to as the source write key) is used to integrate the RudderStack SDK with your application before tracking events from it. You can click on a source and view it in the **Setup** tab.
