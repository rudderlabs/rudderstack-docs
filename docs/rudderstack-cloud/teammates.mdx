# Teammates (User Management)

The **Teammates** feature lets you add and manage other users in the current workspace of RudderStack dashboard. It also enables easier collaboration between you and other members of your team or organization.

The below table specifies the number of teammates you can add to your workspace in different RudderStack Cloud plans:

## User permissions

An invited user can be assigned any of the following three roles:

### Read-Only

This user role has the following permissions:

| Option       | View | Add | Modify | Delete |
| :----------- | :--- | :-- | :----- | :----- |
| [Sources](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/sources/)     | Yes  | No  | No     | No     |
| [Destinations](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/destinations/) | Yes  | No  | No     | No     |

| [Transformations](https://rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/) | Yes  | No  | No     | No     |

Some things to note regarding the read-only user permissions:
- Read-only users can view the settings of all the destinations. However, secrets like access keys are hidden from them.
- They can run tests on existing transformations but they cannot add, modify, or delete transformations.
- They can also view any secrets, like API keys in the transformation code.
