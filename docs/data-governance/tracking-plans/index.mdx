# Tracking Plans

Tracking Plans let you proactively monitor and act on non-compliant event data coming into your RudderStack sources based on predefined plans. This can help you prevent or de-risk situations where missing or improperly configured event data can break your downstream destinations.

## Tracking Plan features

With the help of a Tracking Plan, you can:

* Define specific event names and properties for your `track` calls.
* Specify whether a property/attribute is required and assign a particular data type.
* Have better control of your data streaming by supporting a versioning system.
* Use the [Data Governance API](https://rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/rudderstack-data-governance-api/) to evaluate your inbound events and metadata, and compare them with your plans.

## Quick start

To start using the Tracking Plans, follow these steps:

1. Generate a [personal access token](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/personal-access-tokens/) in the RudderStack dashboard.
2. Make a copy of the [RudderStack Tracking Plan Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QnCY3dbzyz2InB68W3AGIJshsuY3Zu8WA3AfMMxIzAQ/edit#gid=1810167975) to create or update your tracking plans.
3. Connect your Tracking Plan to a source. For more information, refer to the [Tracking Plan Spreadsheet](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/tracking-plans/tracking-plan-spreadsheet/#linking-tracking-plan-to-a-source) documentation.
4. (Optional) Use [RudderTyper](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/ruddertyper/) for autocomplete and linting.

## Tracking Plan API

The [Tracking Plan API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/16242548/TzeWFT6D#3b19ae74-4a42-4078-b9f8-4aa006817c63) lets you build applications or scripts on top of RudderStack's Tracking Plan capabilities. This includes a simple CI/CD pipeline, integrations with other Tracking Plan systems such as Amplitude, Mixpanel, Avo, and many other creative use-cases.

### Using the Tracking Plan API

To use the Tracking Plan API, follow these steps:

1. Generate a [personal access token](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/personal-access-tokens/) in the RudderStack dashboard.
2. Refer to the [Tracking API documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/16242548/TzeWFT6D#7df289e7-8758-4ec0-a86e-3aa08bd3260e) in Postman.

## FAQ

### Which calls are supported by the tracking plans?

The Tracking Plans feature currently supports only [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/track/) events.

### Does RudderStack propagate the context related to any tracking plan violations?

Currently, RudderStack propagates any context related to the tracking plan violations **only to theÂ data warehouses** but not all the destinations. You can use this context in your <Link to="/transformations">Transformations</Link> for filtering or modifying the events before they reach the destination.

If you have defined the <Link to="/data-governance/tracking-plans/tracking-plan-spreadsheet/#global-settings">tracking plan global settings</Link> such that **Allow unplanned events** is set to `FALSE`, the events that are explicitly dropped via the tracking plan will not reach any destination.
