Dest_Name

**Add introduction about the destination platform. For example, you can say "Google Analytics is the world's most popular analytics service that lets you track, analyze, and report your website traffic across a variety of sources." for Google Analytics destination platform.**

Getting Started

**Add information on how to get started with the destination platform set up.**

Before configuring **Dest_Name** as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by **Dest_Name** by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     |  |             |              |
| **Cloud mode**      |  |             |              |               |             

**To know about connection modes, please refer[https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/](https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/)**

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to "Dest_Name", follow these steps:

**Mention the steps to set up the destination platform in the RudderStack dashboard. Add details about the configurable settings and where to get them, if applicable. For example:  **<Dest_Name> API Key**: Enter your <Dest_Name> API key here. You can obtain this key by logging into the <Dest_Name> console (provide URL to the console) and navigating to Settings - API key.**
