# Event Replay 

RudderStack's **Event Replay** feature lets you backup your event data and replay it in case of any failures.

<div class="infoBlock">

Event Replay is an enterprise-only feature. For more information on the features included in this plan, refer to the RudderStack <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/pricing/">pricing</a> page.

</div>

RudderStack can store the following types of event data and replay it to the specified destinations: 
- Raw events captured by RudderStack through various sources (stored in batches of 100,000 events).
- Event payloads sent by RudderStack in case of delivery failures along with the errors (stored approximately every 30 seconds).

## Data storage options

You can choose any of the the below-mentioned options:

- **No Data Retention**: No event data is stored and hence cannot be replayed.
- **RudderStack S3 Storage** (default): Event data is stored in RudderStack's Amazon S3 bucket on a rolling 30-day basis.
- **Choose your Object Storage**: Event data is stored in your Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, or MinIO bucket. 

The below section provides more details on how to set up your object storage.

### Object storage setup

Refer to the following settings depending on your cloud provider:
