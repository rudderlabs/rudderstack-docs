# RudderStack Open Source

Follow the guides in this section if you want to set up RudderStack in your preferred development environment.

<div class="infoBlock">

The <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server">RudderStack backend</a> is written in Go, with a simple React.js UI to manage your sources, destinations, and the connections between them.
</div>

## Overview

Installing and setting up open source RudderStack involves the following steps:

1. Setting up the control plane to manage your source and destination configurations.

        preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"
        height="1em"
        width="1em"
        fill="none"
        xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
        viewBox="0 0 24 24"
        strokeWidth="2"
        strokeLinecap="round"
        strokeLinejoin="round"
        stroke="currentColor"
        class="rightRefArrow"
      >
        <g>
          <line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line>
          <polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline>
        </g>
      </svg>
    </span>
    <span class="mainRefText">
      Control Plane Setup
    </span>
  </div>
</a>

2. Setting up the data plane(backend) for RudderStack to track, process, and route the events.

        xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
        viewBox="0 0 24 24"
        strokeWidth="2"
        strokeLinecap="round"
        strokeLinejoin="round"
        stroke="currentColor"
        class="rightRefArrow"
      >
        <g>
          <line x1="5" y1="12" x2="19" y2="12"></line>
          <polyline points="12 5 19 12 12 19"></polyline>

      </svg>
    </span>
    <span class="mainRefText">
      Data Plane Setup
    </span>
  </div>
</a>

3. Sending test events to verify your RudderStack installation.

## FAQ

### Do I need to sign up for an account to set up open source RudderStack?

Signing up for the [RudderStack-hosted web app](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup?type=opensource) is the easiest way to set up and manage your data pipelines. The web app is only used for source/destination configuration and does not have access to your data. It also provides a [Live Events](https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/live-events/) feature for debugging purposes, only for a limited time. 

**RudderStack does not persist any of your data**.

However, if you do not wish to sign up for RudderStack and want to self-host the source/destination configurations, you can use the open source [Control Plane Lite](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-open-source/control-plane-lite/) utility. To set up the RudderStack server (backend) in your own environment, follow the steps listed in the [Setup instructions](#setup-instructions) section for your preferred platform.

<div class="warningBlock">

The control plane set up using Control Plane Lite does not have features like <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/transformations">Transformations</a> and the ability to view <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/live-events/">live events</a>.
</div>

### What is a data plane URL? Where do I get it?

For routing and processing the events to the RudderStack backend, a **data plane URL** is required.

- If you're using open source RudderStack, you are required to set up your own data plane by [installing and setting up RudderStack](#setup-instructions) in your preferred environment.

<div class="infoBlock">

An open source RudderStack data plane URL typically looks like <code class="inline-code">http:localhost:8080</code>, where <code class="inline-code">8080</code> is the port where your RudderStack data plane is hosted.
</div>

- If you're using [RudderStack Cloud Free](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup?type=freetrial), the data plane URL is provided in the dashboard.
- If you're using the [pro/enterprise](https://rudderstack.com/pricing) version of RudderStack, [contact us](mailto:%20support@rudderstack.com) for the data plane URL with the email ID you used to sign up for RudderStack.
