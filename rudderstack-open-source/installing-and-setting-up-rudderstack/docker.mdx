# Docker

This guide lists the steps required to set up the RudderStack server (backend) in your Docker environment.

The Docker setup is the easiest and the fastest way to get up and running with RudderStack.

## RudderStack-hosted control plane

If you're using a RudderStack-hosted control plane, follow these steps to set up the data plane in your Docker environment:

1. Log into your [RudderStack Open Source dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup?type=opensource).
2. Note and copy your workspace token from the top of the page, as shown:

<div class="infoBlock">

The workspace token is required for setting up the data plane.
</div>

3. Download the `rudder-docker.yml` [docker-compose](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server/master/rudder-docker.yml) file.
4. Replace `<your_workspace_token>` in this file with the workspace token copied above.
5. Then, open your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to install RudderStack, and run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose -f rudder-docker.yml up
```

## Self-hosted control plane

If you have self-hosted the control plane using the open-source [Control Plane Lite](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-open-source/control-plane-lite/) utility, follow [Docker instructions](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-open-source/control-plane-lite/#docker) to set up the data plane.

## Sending test events

Once you have successfully performed the steps above, follow the [Sending Test Events](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-open-source/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack/sending-test-events/) guide to verify the installation.
