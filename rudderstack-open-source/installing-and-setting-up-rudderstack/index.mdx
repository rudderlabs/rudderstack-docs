# Install and Set Up RudderStack

<div class="successBlock">
  The easiest way to get started with RudderStack is to sign up for free on <a href="https://app.rudderlabs.com/signup?type=freetrial">
    RudderStack Cloud Free
  </a>.
</div>

## Setup Instructions

- Setup instructions for [**Docker**](docker/)
- Setup instructions for [**Kubernetes**](kubernetes/)
- Instructions for a [**Developer Machine Setup**](developer-machine-setup/)

<div class="warningBlock">

  If you are planning to use RudderStack in production, we strongly recommend
  using the <a href="kubernetes/">Kubernetes</a> Helm charts. We update our
  Docker images with bug fixes much more frequently than our <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server">GitHub repository</a>.
</div>

## FAQs

### What is a Data Plane URL? Where do I get it?

<div class="infoBlock">

  Refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/rudderstack-architecture">RudderStack Architecture</a> guide for more information the RudderStack Data Plane.
</div>

For routing and processing the events to the RudderStack backend, a **Data Plane URL** is required.

Here's how to get the Data Plane URL:

- If you're using the **open-source** version of RudderStack, you are required to set up your own Data Plane by [**installing and setting up RudderStack**](./) in your preferred environment.

<div class="successBlock">
  An open-source Data Plane URL looks like
  <code class="inline-code">http:localhost:8080</code> where
  <code class="inline-code">8080</code> is typically the port where your
  RudderStack Data Plane is hosted.
</div>

- If you're using [**RudderStack Cloud** **Free**](https://app.rudderlabs.com/signup?type=freetrial), the data plane URL is provided in the dashboard.
- If you're using the [**pro or enterprise**](https://rudderstack.com/pricing) version of RudderStack, please contact us for the Data Plane URL with the email ID you used to sign up for RudderStack.

### How to Check the Data Plane Status?

To check your Data Plane status, run the following command:

```bash
CURL <DATA_PLANE_URL>/health
```

A sample command to check the Data Plane status is as shown:

```bash
CURL https://hosted.rudderlabs.com/health
```

You will get the following output:

```
{"server":"UP", "db":"UP","acceptingEvents":"TRUE","routingEvents":"TRUE","mode":"NORMAL","goroutines":"15364", "backendConfigMode": "API", "lastSync":"2020-12-01T04:20:33Z", "lastRegulationSync":"2020-11-30T21:40:27Z"}
```

The RudderStack server supports two running modes:

- **Normal** \(`"mode": "NORMAL"`\): In this mode, the RudderStack server runs as expected, and there are no issues.
- **Degraded** \(`"mode": "DEGRADED"`\): RudderStack enters the degraded mode if it keeps crashing while processing the events after a threshold number of restarts is reached. RudderStack still receives and stores the events in this mode but does not process them and route them to your specified destinations.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the RudderStack Server running modes, refer to our <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/user-guides/administrators-guide/high-availability/">High Availability</a> guide.

</div>

### Why Do I Need a RudderStack Account?

Using the [**RudderStack web app**](https://app.rudderstack.com/) is the easiest way to set up and manage your event data sources, destinations and transformations.

<div class="infoBlock">

The web app is only used for source/destination configuration and does not have access to your data.

The <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/live-events/">Live Events</a> console can be used to temporarily stream events for debugging purposes, but only for a limited time. **RudderStack does not persist any of your data**.

</div>

If you do not wish to sign up for RudderStack and want to self-host the Control Plane, you can do so using the open-source [**Control Plane Lite**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/user-guides/how-to-guides/rudderstack-control-plane-lite/).

<div class="warningBlock">

Note that the Control Plane set up using the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/user-guides/how-to-guides/rudderstack-control-plane-lite/">Control Plane Lite</a> does not have features like <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/transformations"> Transformations</a> and <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/live-events/">Live Events</a>.
</div>
