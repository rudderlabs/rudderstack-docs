# Transformations

Transformations is one of RudderStack's key features. It gives you the ability to code custom JavaScript functions to implement specific use-cases on your event data, like:

* Filtering/sampling events.
* Enriching events by implementing static logic or leveraging an external API.
* Cleaning/aggregating data.
* Data masking or removing sensitive PII information in the events to ensure data privacy.
* Implementing external actions on the events using an API.

{% hint style="success" %}
Transformations can be used across your [**Event Stream**](../stream-sources/), [**Warehouse Actions**](../warehouse-actions/), and [**Cloud Extract**](../cloud-extract-sources/) pipelines.
{% endhint %}

Here's a quick 2-minute walkthrough of this feature:

{% hint style="info" %}
For details on how to add a transformation in RudderStack, check the [**Adding a New Transformation**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/adding-a-new-user-transformation-in-rudderstack#adding-a-transformation) section below.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
You can refer to our [**Transformations**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/sample-user-transformers) GitHub repository for some useful templates that you can use to create your own user transformations.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Transformations only work for the Cloud mode destinations.**

To know more about the Cloud mode in RudderStack, check out the [**RudderStack Connection Modes**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/get-started/rudderstack-connection-modes) guide.
{% endhint %}

## Adding a Transformation

* Log into your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/).
* Click on the [**Transformations**](https://app.rudderstack.com/transformations) link from the left panel in the dashboard, as shown:

  ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2890%29.png)

* Click on the **Create New** option as shown:

  ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2892%29.png)

* Next, assign a name for this new transformation. Enter the transformation function's code in the **Transformation** window, as shown:

  ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28100%29.png)

* Add your transformation code within the `transformEvent` function in the **Transformation** window. You can also add other functions and call them from within `transformEvent`.

  ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2899%29.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
Our [**Transformations**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/sample-user-transformers) GitHub repository contains some useful templates that you can use to create your own transformations.

You can copy-paste the entire code of any of the functions present in this repository into the **Transformation** window.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember to delete the pre-populated `transformEvent` function in such cases, before pasting your code.
{% endhint %}

* RudderStack also gives you the ability to test your transformation function with the **Run Test** option as shown:

  ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2897%29.png)

* In case you want to perform any aggregation/roll-up operation on a micro batch of events, use the `transformBatch` feature, as shown:

```javascript
/***  
* This function gets executed on a batch of events before it gets pushed to a destination
* events => JSON list of events sent to rudder
* metadata (optional) => Javascript function which can be used to access metadata of
*                        the given event by calling metadata(event)  
* After all the transformations are done, the final event that 
* needs to be pushed to the destination should be returned by this function
***/

export function transformBatch(events, metadata) {      
  return events;
}
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Disclaimer for using `transformBatch`**

Make sure you pass on the `messageID` from the input event onto the output event. If the `messageID` is passed on, the order of delivery of events is preserved. **Without it, this order may not be maintained**.

It is highly recommended to use `transformEvent` in every possible case as it ensures event ordering in all cases.

In case a `transformBatch` is required and event ordering is important, make sure to pass on the `messageID`.
{% endhint %}

## Libraries

One of the key features of RudderStack Transformations is the ability to reuse code written for a transformation in other transformations as well. For this, RudderStack lets you create libraries or functions that can be reused in different transformations.

To create a library, follow these steps:

* Click on the [**Transformations**](https://app.rudderstack.com/transformations) link in the left nav bar and go to the **Libraries** section. Click on the **Create New** option to add new libraries, as shown:

  ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2889%29.png)

* Add the library's **Name**, an optional **Description**, and include the custom functions that you need to reuse across all other transformations.

  ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2891%29.png)

* You can add more functions under a single library, as shown:

  ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2895%29.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**RudderStack does not support the deletion of libraries as of now.**

This is to ensure that you don't break any existing transformations that use the library that you might be trying to delete.
{% endhint %}

## Using Libraries in Transformations

To use the libraries in your existing transformation, simply take the name of your library and convert it into **camel case without spaces** - this becomes your library handle.

For example, if your library name is **`is rudder email`**, then the library handle would be **`isRudderEmail`**.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28101%29.png)

Let's say you want to import a function called **`rudderEmail`**, which returns `true` for the emails from a specific domain \(e.g. RudderStack\) and `false` otherwise, from the **`is rudder email`** library. Also, you want to use this function to filter the events that don't have the email address of the specified domain.

The following code snippet demonstrates how we can implement this use-case:

```javascript
import { rudderEmail } from 'isRudderEmail';
export function transformEvent(event) {
  const email = event.context && event.context.traits && event.context.traits.email;
  if (email && !rudderEmail(email)) return;
  return event;
}
```

On running a test, an example event not having the specified email domain is filtered out, as shown:

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2886%29.png)

### Importing Multiple Functions From Single Library

When importing a single function or multiple functions from a library, it is important to keep the import statement to one line. Breaking the import function out into multiple lines will lead to an error.

The following snippets highlight how to properly import functions from a library:

```javascript
// Correct Way ✅
// --------------

import { getPrice } from getFinanceData;

// OR

import { getPrice, getRevenue, getProfit } from getFinanceData;
```

```javascript
// Incorrect Way ❌
// ----------------

import { 
  getPrice 
} from getFinanceData;

// OR

import { 
  getPrice, 
  getRevenue, 
  getProfit 
} from getFinanceData;
```

## Accessing Metadata

RudderStack injects a function `metadata(event)` into your transformations as an argument. This allows you to access the event metadata variables that help you customize your transformations.

{% hint style="info" %}
`metadata()` takes the event as input and returns the metadata of the event.
{% endhint %}

The following properties, if available, are present in the metadata response:

| Property Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `sourceId` | This refers to the ID of the source configured on your RudderStack dashboard. Note that it different from the source **Write Key**. Refer to the image below for more details. |
| `destinationId` | ID of the destination configured on your RudderStack dashboard. |
| `messageId` | Corresponds to the unique ID for each event. |
| `sessionId` | If sessions are enabled, this corresponds to the value of the session ID. |

![Source ID](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2898%29.png)

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28120%29%20%281%29%20%281%29.png)

Since you may not need the metadata in every transformation, you can optionally access it by including it in your function signature as an argument wherever required.

An example of this is as shown below:

```javascript
export function transformEvent(event, metadata) {
  const meta = metadata(event);
  event.sourceId = meta.sourceId;
  return event;
}
```

## External API Requests

You can make any number of external API requests in your transformation functions and use the response to enrich your events data. RudderStack injects an asynchronous `fetch(url)` function into your transformations. It makes an API call to the given URL and returns the response in a JSON format.

An example of how to use the `fetch` function in transformations is shown below:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Basic" %}
```javascript
export async function transformEvent(event) {
  const res = await fetch("any_api_endpoint");
  event.response = JSON.stringify(res);
  return event;
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="POST" %}
```javascript
export async function transformEvent(event) {
  const res = await fetch("post_url", {
    method: "POST", // POST, PUT, DELETE, GET, etc.
    body: JSON.stringify(event),
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json;charset=UTF-8"
    }
  });
  event.response = JSON.stringify(res);
  return event;
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Headers" %}
```javascript
export async function transformEvent(event) {
  const res = await fetch("post_url", {
    method: "POST", // POST, PUT, DELETE, GET, etc.
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json;charset=UTF-8",
      "Authorization": "Bearer <your_authorization_token>"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(event)
  });
  event.response = JSON.stringify(res);
  return event;
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="success" %}
To see how this feature is used in more detail, check out the [**Clearbit enrichment example**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/sample-user-transformers/blob/sampleTransformationV1/EnrichWithClearbit.js) which uses the `fetch` function.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For improved performance, we recommend using `batch` API requests instead of a separate API request for each event whenever possible.
{% endhint %}

## Debugging with Logs

You can access event-related logs while running a test by including the `log()` function in your transformation code. An example of this is as shown:

```javascript
export function transformEvent(event, metadata) {
  const meta = metadata(event);
  event.sourceId = meta.sourceId;

  log(`Event Name is ${event.event}; Message Id is ${event.messageId}`);
  log(`Source Id is ${meta.sourceId}`);

  return event;
}
```

On running a test on the above code, you can see the logs in the **Logs** section of the  dashboard, as shown:

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28103%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%281%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%282%29%20%281%29.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
Arguments to the `log` function can be a String, Number or Object.
{% endhint %}

## Limits

You should take into account the memory and time limits when adding a new transformation. Each invocation of the transformation should not exceed the following limits:

| Parameter | Limit |
| :--- | :--- |
| Memory Limit | 8 MB |
| Time Limit | 4 seconds |

{% hint style="warning" %}
The user transformation fails if these limits are exceeded.
{% endhint %}
