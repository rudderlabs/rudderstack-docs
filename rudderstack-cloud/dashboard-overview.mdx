</div>

For routing and processing the events to the RudderStack backend, a **Data Plane URL** is required. 

Here's how to get the Data Plane URL:

* If you're using the **open-source** version of RudderStack, you are required to set up your own Data Plane by [**installing and setting up RudderStack**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack/) in your preferred environment. 

<div class="successBlock">

An open-source Data Plane URL looks like `http:localhost:8080` where `8080` is typically the port where your RudderStack Data Plane is hosted.  
</div>

* If you're using [**RudderStack Cloud Free**](https://app.rudderlabs.com/signup?type=freetrial), the data plane URL is provided in the dashboard. 
* If you're using the [**pro or enterprise**](https://rudderstack.com/pricing) version of RudderStack, [**contact us**](https://rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack-community) for the Data Plane URL with the email ID you used to sign up for RudderStack.
