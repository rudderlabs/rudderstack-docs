# Dashboard Overview

Once you [sign up](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup) for RudderStack Cloud, you are presented with a dashboard that lets you set up and manage all your event data sources, destinations, and connections through an easy-to-use, intuitive UI.

## Connections

This option lets you configure and connect different sources and destinations to build efficient data pipelines across your entire customer data stack. You can add a source and destination by clicking on the respective buttons as shown:

The **Token** and **Data Plane URL** options observed in the above image are explained below:

### Token

A token is a unique identifier associated with your current RudderStack workspace. It is useful when you want to install and set up open-source RudderStack or accessing various RudderStack API.

<div class="infoBlock">

### Data Plane URL

</div>

For routing and processing the events to the RudderStack backend, a **Data Plane URL** is required. 

Here's how to get the Data Plane URL:

* If you're using [RudderStack Cloud Free](https://app.rudderlabs.com/signup?type=freetrial), the data plane URL is provided in the dashboard itself. 
* If you're using the [pro or enterprise](https://rudderstack.com/pricing) version of RudderStack, [**contact us**](https://rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack-community) for the Data Plane URL with the email ID you used to sign up for RudderStack.
* If you're using the **open-source** version of RudderStack, you are required to set up your own Data Plane by [installing and setting up RudderStack](https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack/) in your preferred environment. 

<div class="successBlock">

An open-source Data Plane URL looks like `http:localhost:8080` where `8080` is typically the port where your RudderStack Data Plane is hosted.
