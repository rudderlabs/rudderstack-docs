# Dashboard Overview

Once you [sign up](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup) for RudderStack Cloud, you are presented with a dashboard that lets you set up and manage all your event data sources, destinations, and connections through an easy-to-use, intuitive UI.

## Connections

This option lets you configure and connect different sources and destinations to build efficient data pipelines across your entire customer data stack. You can add a source and destination by clicking on the respective buttons as shown:

  Refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/connections/">Connections</a> guide for more details
  on setting up your data pipelines in RudderStack.
</div>

You can also observe the **Token** and **Data Plane URL** in the RudderStack dashboard which are explained in detail below:

### Token

A token is a unique identifier associated with your current RudderStack workspace. It is useful when you want to install and set up open-source RudderStack or accessing various RudderStack API.

<div class="infoBlock">

See the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack/">Install and Set up RudderStack</a> guide for steps on installing open-source RudderStack in your preferred development environment.

See the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api">RudderStack API</a> guide for details on various available RudderStack API and how to use them.

### Data Plane URL

<div class="infoBlock">

</div>

For routing and processing the events to the RudderStack backend, a **Data Plane URL** is required. 

Here's how to get the Data Plane URL:

* If you're using [**RudderStack Cloud Free**](https://app.rudderlabs.com/signup?type=freetrial), the data plane URL is provided in the dashboard. 
* If you're using the [**pro or enterprise**](https://rudderstack.com/pricing) version of RudderStack, [**contact us**](https://rudderstack.com/join-rudderstack-slack-community) for the Data Plane URL with the email ID you used to sign up for RudderStack.
* If you're using the **open-source** version of RudderStack, you are required to set up your own Data Plane by [**installing and setting up RudderStack**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack/) in your preferred environment. 

<div class="successBlock">

An open-source Data Plane URL looks like `http:localhost:8080` where `8080` is typically the port where your RudderStack Data Plane is hosted.
