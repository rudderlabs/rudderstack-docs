# Connections

RudderStack lets you set up connections to build efficient data pipelines across your entire customer data stack. You can add your preferred event data sources and destinations and establish connections between them to send your event data.

## Setting up a connection

Setting up a connection in RudderStack involves the following steps:

### Step 1: Setting up a source

1. Log in to the **RudderStack dashboard**.
