# Connections

RudderStack lets you set up connections to build efficient data pipelines across your entire customer data stack. You can add your preferred event data sources and destinations and establish connections between them to send your event data.

## Setting up a connection

Setting up a connection in RudderStack involves the following steps:

### Step 1: Setting up a source

1. Log in to the **RudderStack dashboard**.

### Step 2: Setting up a destination connected to source

1. Click **Add Destination** > **Create New Destination** from the **Source Details** window.

Alternatively, you can choose an existing destination by clicking on **Use Existing Destination**

2. Select the destination you want to configure with the source and click **Next**.

3. Configure the destination with the relevant connection settings.

You can view this connection in your RudderStack dashboard by clicking on the **Connections** tab on the left navigation bar, as shown:
