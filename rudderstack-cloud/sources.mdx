# Sources

In RudderStack, a **source** refers to a platform or an application (web, mobile, server-side, or a third-party cloud app) from where RudderStack can track and collect your event data.

<div class="infoBlock">

  You can configure a source for every unique source of data. Also, you can also create multiple sources for each website or application from where you want to track the data.
</div>

RudderStack Cloud provides **Sources** option in the left navigation bar that allows you to view all the configured sources in the RudderStack dashboard:

## Source details

To get details about a configured source, click on it to see following view on the dashboard:

These options can be explained as follows:

- **Rename**: Lets you rename the source by clicking the edit icon next to the source's name.

- **Write Key**: It is required to send the data from your source.

For example, you can load [**RudderStack's JavaScript SDK**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) on your website to track and collect the events by running the following snippet:

```javascript
  rudderanalytics.load(<WRITE_KEY>, <DATA_PLANE_URL>, options);
```

- **Add Destination**: Lets you add a new destination connected to this source.

<div class="infoBlock">

If you have already configured a destination in RudderStack, you can also use it by clicking on **Add Destination** > **Use Existing Destination**.
</div>

- **Live Events**: Lets you view the real-time event data flowing through RudderStack. Refer to [Live Events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/live-events/) for more information.

- **Events**: Displays all the latest metrics related to the event delivery such as number of events successfully delivered, failed events, etc. You can also filter these by time period.

- **Settings**: This option provides additional source-related details, such as:  

  - **Enabled**: Lets you enable or disable syncing data from this source.

  - **Source ID**: Unique identifier associated with your source.

  - **Permanently delete source**: Lets you delete a source by clicking on the **Delete** button.
