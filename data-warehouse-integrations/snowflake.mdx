---

# Snowflake

Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehouse provided as Software-as-a-Service \(SaaS\). It offers all the features of a modern data warehouse, including scalability, ease of use, secure access to your data, accelerated analytics capabilities, and much more.

RudderStack allows you to configure Snowflake as a destination to dump your event data seamlessly.

<div class="infoBlock">

Please check our <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/data-warehouse-integrations/warehouse-schemas/">Warehouse Schemas</a> guide to know how events are mapped to the tables in Snowflake.

</div>

<div class="successBlock">

  **Find the open-source transformer code for this destination in our <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/v0/destinations/snowflake">GitHub repo</a>.**
</div>

## Snowflake User Setup

To enable RudderStack access, please make sure you have an `ACCOUNTADMIN`, or an account that has `MANAGE GRANTS`.

The following sections illustrate how to create a virtual warehouse, a database, a role, and an user in Snowflake:

### Creating a Virtual Warehouse

Create a `X-Small warehouse`by following the wizard on Snowflake's website as shown in the screenshot below:

<img src="../assets/screenshot-2020-03-31-at-11.56.32-am.png" /><span class="imageTitle">creating x-small warehouse screenshot</span>

<div class="infoBlock">

You can set your data warehouse size as per your future data volume.

</div>

Alternatively, you can also use SQL to create a warehouse, as shown:

```sql
CREATE WAREHOUSE "RUDDER_WAREHOUSE"
  WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL'
    WAREHOUSE_TYPE = 'STANDARD'
    AUTO_SUSPEND = 600
    AUTO_RESUME = TRUE;
```

<div class="infoBlock">

It is recommended that you set <code class="inline-code">AUTO_SUSPEND</code> to ~10 mins, and enable <code class="inline-code">AUTO_RESUME</code> to avoid any extra costs.

</div>

### Creating a Database

<div class="warningBlock">

Please create a new database to avoid conflicts with your existing data, as RudderStack creates its own tables.

</div>

The following screenshot demonstrates the **Create Database** option in Snowflake.

<img src="../assets/screenshot-2020-02-27-at-5.33.31-pm.png" /><span class="imageTitle">Creating a database in Snowflake</span>

Alternatively, you can also use SQL to create a database, as shown:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE "RUDDER_EVENTS";
```

### Creating a Role for RudderStack

Please execute the following SQL commands to create a new role with the required permissions to load your data into the warehouse:

- Create a new role

```sql
CREATE ROLE "RUDDER";
```

- Grant access to the virtual warehouse

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE "RUDDER_WAREHOUSE" TO ROLE "RUDDER";
```

- Grant access to the database

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE "RUDDER_EVENTS" TO ROLE "RUDDER";
GRANT CREATE SCHEMA ON DATABASE "RUDDER_EVENTS" TO ROLE "RUDDER";
GRANT ALL ON ALL SCHEMAS IN DATABASE "RUDDER_EVENTS" TO ROLE "RUDDER";
```

### Creating a User

Finally, please create a user to connect RudderStack to the previously created Snowflake warehouse, as shown:

<img src="../assets/screenshot-2020-02-27-at-5.34.41-pm.png" /><span class="imageTitle">Creating a user in Snowflake</span>

Alternatively, you can use SQL to create a user in Snowflake, as shown:

```sql
CREATE USER "RUDDER_USER"
  MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD = FALSE
  DEFAULT_ROLE = "RUDDER"
  PASSWORD = "strong_unique_password";
GRANT ROLE "RUDDER" TO USER "RUDDER_USER";
```

## Configuring Snowflake in RudderStack

In order to enable dumping data to Snowflake, you will first need to add it as a destination to the source from which you are sending event data. Once the destination is enabled, events from RudderStack will start to flow to Snowflake.

To do so, please follow these steps:

- Choose a source to which you would like to add Snowflake as a destination. You can also simply create a destination and connect it to a source later.

<div class="infoBlock">

Please follow our <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/">Adding a Source and Destination</a> guide to know how to add a source in RudderStack.

</div>

- After choosing a source, select **Snowflake** from the list of destinations.
- Give your destination a name and then click on **Next**. You should then see the following screen:
<img src="../assets/4 (3) (2) (2) (1) (2).png" /><span class="imageTitle">Connection Settings for configuring Snowflake as a Destination</span>

<img src="../assets/5 (2).png" /><span class="imageTitle">Connection Settings for configuring Snowflake as a Destination</span>

- Add the required credentials in the **Connection Settings** as described below:

  - **Account** - This is the account ID of your warehouse. Account ID is part of the Snowflake URL. The following examples illustrate the slight differences in the account ID for various cloud providers**.**

  | Account ID sample           | Snowflake URL                                                    | Snowflake cloud provider                                        |

**Configuring snowflake integration with AWS **

<ol>
<li>Create a policy in AWS:</li>

Replace <code class="inline-code">&lt;bucket&gt;</code> and <code class="inline-code">&lt;prefix&gt;</code> with your values in the JSON below. And create the policy with a name of your choice.
<span>

```javascript
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:GetObjectVersion",
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:DeleteObjectVersion"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>/<prefix>/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket>",
      "Condition": {
        "StringLike": {
          "s3:prefix": ["<prefix>/*"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
</span>
<li>
  Create a role and attach the above policy in AWS: - Create role of type <strong>
    Another AWS account
  </strong> - Enter your AWS account ID and enable <strong>
    Require External ID
  </strong> - For external ID enter a dummy ID such as 0000. We will modify this
  later on. - And attach the policy created in Step 1. - Give your role a name and
  keep the role ARN handy for the next step.
</li>
<li> Create cloud storage integration in Snowflake </li>
<span>

```sql
CREATE STORAGE INTEGRATION <integration_name>
  TYPE = EXTERNAL_STAGE
  STORAGE_PROVIDER = S3
  ENABLED = TRUE
  STORAGE_AWS_ROLE_ARN = '<iam_role>'
  STORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS = ('s3://<bucket>/<path>/', 's3://<bucket>/<path>/')
  [ STORAGE_BLOCKED_LOCATIONS = ('s3://<bucket>/<path>/', 's3://<bucket>/<path>/') ]
```
</span>
<code class="inline-code">&lt;integration_name&gt;</code> with an integration
name of your choice.
<code class="inline-code">&lt;iam_role&gt;</code> with the role ARN from the
previous step.

Record the values: <code class="inline-code">&lt;integration_name&gt;</code>.

<li> Retrieve the AWS IAM user for your Snowflake account as shown:</li>
<span>

```sql
DESC INTEGRATION <integration_name>;
```
</span>
<code class="inline-code">&lt;integration_name&gt;</code> - The integration name
used in the previous step.

Record the values - <code class="inline-code">STORAGE_AWS_ROLE_ARN</code> and <code class="inline-code">STORAGE_AWS_EXTERNAL_ID</code> .

<li> Grant IAM user permission to access bucket objects in AWS </li>
Choose the role created in Step 2 and edit the trust relationship with the following
JSON.
<span>

```javascript
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "",

          "sts:ExternalId": "<snowflake_external_id>"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
</span>
<code class="inline-code">&lt;snowflake_user_arn&gt;</code> is the <code class="inline-code">
  STORAGE_AWS_ROLE_ARN
</code> in the previous step.
<code class="inline-code">&lt;snowflake_external_id&gt;</code> is the <code class="inline-code">
  STORAGE_AWS_EXTERNAL_ID
</code> in the previous step.

<li> Grant integration access to role in Snowflake:</li>
<span>

```sql
grant usage on integration <integration_name> to role <sf_role>
```
</span>
  <code class="inline-code">&lt;integration_name&gt;</code> is the integration created in the Step 3.
  <code class="inline-code">&lt;sf_role&gt;</code> is the role in Snowflake you want to grant access to.
