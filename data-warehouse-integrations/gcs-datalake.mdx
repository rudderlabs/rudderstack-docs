# Google Cloud Storage Data Lake

[**Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**](https://cloud.google.com/storage) is a popular web service for storing and accessing your data in the Google Cloud Platform infrastructure. It offers state-of-the-art performance and scalability, along with ensuring the security and privacy of your data.

RudderStack supports GCS data lake as a destination to which you can securely send your data.

## User permissions for GCS data lake

To set up GCS data lake as a destination in RudderStack, you will need to create a new user role and grant the required permissions.

### Creating the role and adding permissions

- Go to **https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/roles** and click on **CREATE ROLE**.
- Then, fill in the details as shown:

- Fill the details and click on **ADD PERMISSIONS**.
- Under **Filter permissions by role**, select **Storage Object Admin** and grant the required permissions:


- The permission required to successfully use the GCS data lake destination is shown:

```
storage.objects.create
```
- Then, click on **CREATE**. This will successfully create the role.

### Creating the service account and attaching the role

- Go to **https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts**.
- Then, select the project containing the dataset that you want to use.
- Next, click on **CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT**.
- Fill in the details as shown below and click on **CREATE AND CONTINUE**.

- Then, select the previously created role and click on **CONTINUE**.

- Finally, after completing Steps 1 and 2, click on **DONE**. 

### Creating and downloading the JSON key

- Click on the three dots under **Actions** in the service account that you just created and select **Manage keys**, as shown: 

- Click on **ADD KEY**, followed by **Create new key**, as shown:

- In the resulting pop-up, select **JSON** and click on **CREATE**.

- Finally, download this JSON file. This file is required while setting up the GCS data lake destination in RudderStack.

## Setting up the GCS data lake destination

To start sending data to your GCS data lake, you will first need to add it as a destination in RudderStack and connect it to a data source. Once the destination is enabled, the events will automatically start flowing to your data lake.

Follow these steps to configure your GCS data lake as a destination in RudderStack:

* From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), configure the data source. Then, select **GCS Data Lake** from the list of destinations.

<div class="infoBlock">

Refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack//">Adding a Source and Destination in RudderStack</a> guide for more information.
</div>

* Assign a name to your destination and click on **Next**. You should then see the following screen:

### Connection settings

Add the following credentials in the **Connection Settings**:

* **Staging GCS Storage Bucket Name**: Enter the name of the S3 bucket that will be used to store data before loading it into the S3 data lake.
* **Prefix**: If specified, RudderStack will create a folder in the bucket with this prefix and push all the data within that folder.
* **Namespace**: If specified, all the data for the destination will be pushed to `https://storage.googleapis.com/<bucketName>/<prefix>/rudder-datalake/<namespace>`.

<div class="infoBlock">

If you don't specify a namespace in the settings, RudderStack sets it to the source name by default.
</div>

* **Credentials**: Enter the content of the downloaded JSON key file in this field.

## Finding your data in the GCS data lake

RudderStack converts your events into Parquet files and dumps them into the configured GCS bucket. Before dumping the events, RudderStack groups the files by the event name based on the time (UTC) they were received. 

The folder structure is similar to the following format:

`https://storage.googleapis.com/<bucketName>/<prefix>/rudder-datalake/<namespace>/<tableName>/YYYY/MM/DD/HH`

As specified in the [**Connnection settings**](#connection-settings) section above:

* `<prefix>` is the GCS prefix used while configuring the GCS data lake destination in RudderStack. If not specified, RudderStack will omit this value.
* `<namespace>` is the namespace specified in the destination settings. If not specified, RudderStack sets it to the source name.
* `<tableName>` is set to the event name.
* `YYYY`, `MM`, `DD`, and `HH` are replaced by the actual time values.

<div class="infoBlock">

A combination of the `YYYY`, `MM`, `DD`, and `HH` values represents the UTC time.
</div>

### Use case

Suppose that RudderStack tracks the following two events:

| Event Name             | Timestamp                                        |
| :-------------------| :----------------------------------|
| Product Purchased | "2019-10-12T08:40:50.52Z" UTC |
| Cart Viewed             | "2019-11-12T09:34:50.52Z" UTC  |

RudderStack then converts these events into Parquet files and dumps them into the following folders:

| Event Name             | Folder Location  |
| :-------------------| :----------------|
| Product Purchased | https://storage.googleapis.com/<bucketName>/<prefix>/rudder-datalake/<namespace>/product_purchased/2019/10/12/08 |
| Cart Viewed             | https://storage.googleapis.com/<bucketName>/<prefix>/rudder-datalake/<namespace>/cart_viewed/2019/11/12/09              |
