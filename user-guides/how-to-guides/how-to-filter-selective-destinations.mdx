# How to Filter Selective Destinations

RudderStack allows you to send your event data only to a few intended destinations by filtering out the rest. For the [JavaScript SDK](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/), you can do so by passing an integrations object in the `options` parameter of the event method. For most of the other SDKs you can use the `integrations` object parameter for the associated event. The filter destination feature is currently only supported for cloud mode integrations.

## How it works

The following is an example of how to send a sample message **only** to `Google Analytics` and `Intercom` in the JavaScript SDK:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify(
  "sample user id",
  {
    email: "name@email.org",
    name: "sample name",
  },
  {
    integrations: {
      All: false,
      "Google Analytics": true,
      Intercom: true,
    },
  }
)
```

<div class="successBlock">

  **NOTE**: Unless explicitly defined otherwise, <code class="inline-code">All</code> is always set to <code class="inline-code">true</code>. This means that sending events to all destinations is enabled by default.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

The line <code class="inline-code">All: false</code> instructs RudderStack **not** to send the event data to any destinations **by default,** unless they are explicitly listed as <code class="inline-code">true</code> in the subsequent lines.

</div>

You can also disable sending event data to certain destinations. In this case, the event data is sent to **all the other destinations** except the specified ones. An example of this is as shown from the JavaScript SDK:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify(
  "sample user id",
  {
    email: "name@email.org",
    name: "sample name",
  },
  {
    integrations: {
      "Google Analytics": false,
      Intercom: false,
    },
  }
)
```

<div class="infoBlock">

As seen in the above code snippet, RudderStack will send the event data to all destinations except <code class="inline-code">Google Analytics</code> and <code class="inline-code">Intercom</code>.

</div>

## Examples

The following are examples for the same `track()` call from a variety of SDKs.

<div class="infoBlock">

Please Note: Some of the SDKs follow their own convention that is different than the examples below. The notable SDKs with different convention are IOS and Android. Please read the respective <code class="inline-code">SDK Integration Guide</code> section for your given SDK to find the correct format to filter selective destinations.

</div>

### JavaScript SDK

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(
  "samplename",
  "sampleEventName",
  {
    email: "name@email.org",
    name: "Samplename",
  },
  {
    integrations: {
      All: false,
      "Amazon S3": true,
      "Heap.io": false,
    },
  }
)
```

### Python SDK

```python
rudder_analytics.track(
    'sample event name',
    {
      'email': 'name@email.org',
      'name': 'sample name'
    },
    integrations={
      'All': False,
      'Amazon S3': True,
      'Heap.io': False
    }
)
```

<div class="infoBlock">

In these examples above, the track events will only be sent to the <code class="inline-code">Amazon S3</code> and <code class="inline-code">Heap.io</code> destinations.

</div>

## Destination Naming Convention

Use the displayed destination name from the [RudderStack directory in your control plane](https://app.rudderstack.com/directory) for the destination name.

<div class="infoBlock">

These destination names are case sensitive.
