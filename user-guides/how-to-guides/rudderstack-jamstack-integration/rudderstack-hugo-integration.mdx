# How to Integrate Rudderstack with a Hugo Site

This guide will help you integrate RudderStack with your Hugo site using the [JavaScript SDK](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/). On successful integration, you can track and send real-time user events to your preferred destinations via RudderStack.

To set up the event stream on your Hugo site, you need to perform the following steps:

1. [Integrate the JavaScript SDK with your Hugo site and set up the tracking code](#integrating-the-javascript-sdk-with-your-hugo-site)
2. [Configure a destination in RudderStack](#configuring-a-destination-in-rudderstack)
3. [Deploy your Hugo site and verify the events](#deploying-your-hugo-site-and-verifying-the-event-stream)

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you have installed and set up your Hugo site. Refer to the [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) for more information.

## Integrating the JavaScript SDK with your Hugo site

Integrating the JavaScript SDK with your Hugo site involves the following steps:

1. [Creating a JavaScript source in RudderStack](#creating-a-javascript-source-in-rudderstack) 
2. [Installing and configuring the JavaScript SDK in your Hugo site](#installing-and-configuring-the-javascript-sdk-in-your-hugo-site)

### Creating a JavaScript source in RudderStack

The RudderStack JavaScript source is required track the events from your Hugo site. Follow these steps to set it up in your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/):

1. Note the data plane URL in your RudderStack dashboard. This is required to set up the JavaScript SDK in your site.

2. Click on the **Sources** button in the left navigation bar and select **New Source** to create a source. Then, select **Event Streams** under **Sources**, and select **JavaScript**.

3. Assign a name to your source and click **Next**.

4. Your JavaScript source is now configured. Note down the write key for this source, as shown:

### Installing and configuring the JavaScript SDK in your Hugo site

To integrate RudderStack with your Hugo site and set up the tracking code, follow the steps below:

1. Open your `index.html` file and insert the following lines of code within the `head` tag:

```html

```

<div class="infoBlock">

Refer to the sample Hugo site in the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-samples">RudderStack Sample Applications</a> repository for more information.
</div>

## Configuring a destination in RudderStack

This section details the steps required to set up a destination platform in RudderStack, where you can send all the events tracked by the JavaScript SDK.

For this guide, Google Analytics is added as a destination.

1. Click on **Add Destination** in RudderStack dashboard's home page.
2. Choose **Google Analytics** from the list of destinations.
3. Assign a name to your destination and click **Next**.
4. Select the JavaScript source configured in the above section and click **Next**.
5. Configure your Google Analytics destination with your Google Analytics **Tracking ID** in the **Connection Settings** page. For details on the other settings, refer to the [Google Analytics documentation](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/analytics/google-analytics-ga/).

<div class="infoBlock">

Optionally, you can add a <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/">user transformation</a> to this destination to transform your events before sending them to Google Analytics. 
</div>

Google Analytics is now configured as a destination. You should be able to see the connection in your RudderStack dashboard, as seen below:

<div class="successBlock">

You can also set up a warehouse destination in RudderStack and send your tracked events to it.
</div>

## Deploying your Hugo site and verifying the event stream

To verify if your event stream is working correctly, deploy your Hugo site and test if the events are tracked and delivered correctly. Follow these steps:

1. From your terminal, navigate to the folder containing your Hugo site.
2. To deploy your Hugo site, run following command:

```bash
hugo server -D
```

3. Open your Hugo site by going to the local server URL (generally `http://localhost:1313/`) on your browser.
4. Go to your browser's developer tools and check the **Network** tab to verify if the RudderStack JavaScript SDK (`rudder-analytics.js`) is loaded correctly.  The following image highlights this option for Google Chrome:

5. Click on the different links or pages in your Hugo site for RudderStack to track these actions.
6. Go to the **Live Events** tab of the JavaScript source you configured in the RudderStack dashboard to check if the events are tracked:

<img src="../../../assets/user-guides/live-events.png" alt="RudderStack live events tab" />

<div class="infoBlock">

You may face a minor delay before the events start showing up in your dashboard and destination.
</div>

7. Upon successful tracking, you will see the events in your RudderStack dashboard:

8. Go to the Google Analytics dashboard and navigate to **Realtime** > **Events** option to check if the events are delivered. Your tracked events will be shown in this window along with other metrics such as number of active users, source platform, etc.
