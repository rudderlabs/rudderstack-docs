# How to Integrate Rudderstack with Your Eleventy Site

This guide will help you easily integrate RudderStack with your Eleventy site using the [**JavaScript SDK**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/). On successful integration, you can track real-time user events and send them to your preferred destinations via RudderStack.

To set up the event streams on your Eleventy site, you need to perform the following steps:

- [Integrating the JavaScript SDK with your Eleventy site](#step1)

- [Configuring a destination in RudderStack](#step2)

- [Deploying your Eleventy site and verifying the events](#step3)

## Prerequisites

You must have installed and set up your Eleventy site already. You can also refer to the official [**Eleventy documentation**](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/getting-started/) for more information on setting up the site.

## <a name="step1">Integrating the JavaScript SDK with your Eleventy site</a>

Integrating the JavaScript SDK with your Next.js app involves the following steps:

- Creating a JavaScript source in RudderStack 
- Installing and configuring the JavaScript SDK in your app

### <a name="step1.1">Creating a JavaScript source in RudderStack</a>

The JavaScript source will be used to track the events from your Eleventy site. Follow these steps to set it up in your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/):

1. Log into [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/) to see the following:

<div class="infoBlock">

Note the <strong>Data Plane URL</strong>. This is required to set up the SDK in your Next.js app.
</div>

2. Click on the **Sources** button in the left navigation bar and select **New Source** to create a source. Further, select **Event Streams** under **Sources**, and select **JavaScript**.

3. Assign a name to your source and click **Next**.

4. Your JavaScript source is now configured. **Note the write key for the source**.

### <a name="step1.2">Installing the JavaScript SDK in your Eleventy site</a>

To integrate RudderStack with your Eleventy site and set up the tracking code, follow the steps below:

1. Open your index.html file and insert the following lines of code within the &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt;tag:

```
<script> 
rudderanalytics=window.rudderanalytics=[];for(var methods=["load","page","track","identify","alias","group","ready","reset","getAnonymousId","setAnonymousId"],i=0;i<methods.length;i++){var method=methods[i];rudderanalytics[method]=function(a){return function(){rudderanalytics.push([a].concat(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments)))}}(method)}rudderanalytics.load("1pBSDA8DDqVgLRzxN5JWyKJQoNN","https://hosted.rudderlabs.com"),
rudderanalytics.page();
rudderanalytics.track(
  "Test Event in 11ty",
  {
    revenue:  30,
    currency:  'INR' ,
    user_actual_id:  12345
  }, 
  () => {console.log("Track call");}
);
</script>
<script src="https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/rudder-analytics.min.js"></script>

```


<div class="infoBlock">

Refer to the sample Eleventy site in the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-analytics-eleventy">RudderStack Eleventy Site Repository</a> for more information.
</div>

## <a name="step2">Configuring a destination in RudderStack</a>

This section details the steps required to set up a destination platform in RudderStack where you can send all the events tracked by the JavaScript SDK integrated with your Eleventy site.

As an example for this guide, Google Analytics is added as a destination.

1. Click on **Add Destination** in RudderStack dashboard's home page.

2. Choose **Google Analytics** from the list of destinations.

3. Assign a name to your destination and click **Next**.

4. Select the JavaScript source configured in the above section and click **Next**.

5. Configure your Google Analytics destination with your Google Analytics **Tracking ID** in the **Connection Settings** page. For details on the other settings, refer to the [**Google Analytics documentation**]().

Optionally, you can add a [**user transformation**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/) to this destination to transform your events before sending them to Google Analytics. Google Analytics is now configured as a destination. You should be able to see the following source-destination connection in your RudderStack dashboard:

## <a name="step3">Deploying your Eleventy site and verifying the event stream</a>

To verify if your event stream is working correctly, deploy your Eleventy site and test if the events are tracked and delivered correctly. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Deploy your Eleventy site. Then, open the local URL on your browser to view the app.

2. Click on various links on the app to track different events.

3. Go to your browser's developer tools and check the **Network** tab to verify if the RudderStack JavaScript SDK (`rudder-analytics.js`) is loaded correctly,  The following image highlights this option for the Google Chrome browser:

<img src="../../../assets/user-guides/browser-network-tab.png" alt="Chrome Network tab" />

4. Go to the **Live Events** tab of your JavaScript source in the RudderStack dashboard to check if the events are tracked:

<img src="../../../assets/user-guides/live-events.png" alt="RudderStack live events tab" />

<div class="infoBlock">

Sometimes, you may encounter a lag while the events start showing up in your dashboard and destination but they will show up eventually.
</div>

5. Upon successful tracking, you will see the events in your RudderStack dashboard:

<img src="../../../assets/user-guides/successful-live-events.png" alt="RudderStack live events tab" />

6. Go to the Google Analytics dashboard and navigate to **Realtime** > **Events** option to check if the events are delivered to the destination (Google Analytics in this example).

Your tracked events will be shown in this window along with other metrics such as number of active users, source platform, etc.
