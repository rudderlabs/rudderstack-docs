# Software Releases

At RudderStack, we strive to make our deployment simple. To get started, please go through our guide on [installing and setting up RudderStack](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-open-source/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack/) on the platform of your choice.

  If you're using RudderStack in production, we highly recommend using our
  Docker images. Our Docker images are always up-to-date, and well-tested in a
  production environment.
