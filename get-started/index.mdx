# Get Started

[**RudderStack**](https://rudderstack.com/) is a **customer data platform** which captures, processes, and syncs your event, product, and warehouse data to all the tools across your customer data stack. It is an enterprise-ready solution and also provides powerful transformations to customize your event data on the fly.
