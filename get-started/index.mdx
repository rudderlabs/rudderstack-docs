# Get Started

The easiest way to get started with RudderStack is to set up a source, connect it to a destination, and see your event data flow in no time.

## Quick start

Follow these steps to set up a connection in RudderStack:

1. Sign up for [RudderStack Cloud](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup?type=freetrial).
2. You can then access the dashboard for setting up your data pipelines:

3. Click on **Add Source** to set up a data source.

For more information on sources in RudderStack, check out the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/sources/">Sources</a> guide.
</div>

4. Choose the data source from the list of available sources. RudderStack supports the following three types of sources:

    - [Event Streams](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/): Collect your event data from all the web, mobile, and server-side apps, then route it to a wide array of customer tools and data warehouses.
    - [Cloud Extract](https://rudderstack.com/docs/cloud-extract-sources/): Build ELT pipelines from cloud apps to your data warehouse.
    - [Reverse ETL](https://rudderstack.com/docs/reverse-etl/): Leverage your warehouse as a data source for your entire customer data stack.

5. Once you have configured the data source, you will see the following source details page.

<div class="infoBlock">

Note the source <strong>Write key</strong>. This is required for integrating the RudderStack SDK with your source app.
</div>

6. Then, add a destination by clicking on the **Add Destination** button and selecting **Create new destination**.

7. From the list of destinations, select the destination you want to configure for the source. RudderStack currently supports **over 150** destinations, including [event stream](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/) and [warehouse](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-warehouse-integrations/) destinations.
8. Configure the destination by entering the relevant connection settings. For detailed information on these settings, refer to the destination-specific [documentation](https://rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/).

<div class="successBlock">

You can also transform your events in RudderStack before sending them to the destinations. Read the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/">Transformations</a> guide for more information on this feature.
