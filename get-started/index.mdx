RudderStack's backend is written in Go, with a simple, user-friendly UI written in React.js.

## Why RudderStack?

- **Segment API-compatible**: RudderStack is fully compatible with the Segment API. So you don't need to change your app if you are using Segment. Simply integrate the RudderStack SDKs into your app and your events will keep flowing as before \(including your data warehouse\).
- **Processing Flexibility**: With RudderStack's powerful JavaScript-based event transformation framework, you can enhance or transform your event data by combining it with your other internal data.
- **Stand-alone System**: RudderStack runs as a single Go binary with the dependencies being on a PostgreSQL server and a Node.js service. There is no other dependency required to run RudderStack.
- **Platform-independent**: RudderStack is Kubernetes-native and can run on any Kubernetes cluster with our Helm charts. RudderStack is cloud-agnostic and can run on stand-alone machines in all popular cloud platforms, namely AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCP, and others.
- **High Performance**: On a single m4.2xlarge AWS EC2 instance, RudderStack can process 3000 events/second.
- **Enhanced Telemetry**: To help us improve RudderStack, we collect performance and diagnostic metrics about how you use RudderStack, and how it is working. **No customer data is present in the metrics**. For more technical details, please check out our GitHub wiki page on [Telemetry](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server/wiki/RudderStack-Telemetry).
- **Unlimited Events**: Event volume-based pricing of most of the commercial systems is broken. With RudderStack, you are able to collect as much data as possible without worrying about overrunning event budgets.

  - [Cloud Extract](https://rudderstack.com/docs/cloud-extract-sources/): With these sources, you can build ELT pipelines from cloud apps to your data warehouse.
  - [Reverse ETL](https://rudderstack.com/docs/reverse-etl/): With this option, you can leverage the enriched data residing in your data warehouse as a data source for your whole customer data stack.
