## FAQ

### What is the data plane and control plane in RudderStack? How do I set them up?

The data plane is RudderStack's core engine responsible for receiving the event data, transforming it into the required destination format, before relaying those events to the destination.

The control plane manages the configuration of your sources and destinations in RudderStack.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the data plane and control plane in RudderStack, refer to the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/rudderstack-architecture/">Architecture</a> guide.
</div>

In case of **RudderStack Cloud**, RudderStack self-hosts the data plane and the control plane so you don't have to worry about their setup.

For **RudderStack Open Source**, you get the following data plane and control plane setup options:
- You need to [set up the data plane](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack/) in your own environment. **RudderStack will not host it for you**.
- For the control plane, you can either use the [RudderStack-hosted control plane](https://app.rudderstack.com/signup?type=opensource) or [set up your own control plane](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/control-plane-lite/).

<div class="warningBlock">

Features like <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/">Transformations</a> and <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/live-events/">Live Events</a> are not available if you self-host the control plane.
