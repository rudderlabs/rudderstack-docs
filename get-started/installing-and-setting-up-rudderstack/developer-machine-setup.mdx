# Developer Machine Setup

This guide lists the steps required to set up RudderStack in your development environment.

## Introduction

Installing and setting up RudderStack involves two key steps:

- Control plane setup
- Data plane setup

<div class="infoBlock">

Refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/rudderstack-architecture">**RudderStack Architecture**</a> to know more about the RudderStack control plane and data plane.
</div>

## Control plane setup

There are two ways you can set up the control plane. This section lists the steps involved in each of them.

### Using the RudderStack-hosted control plane

- Sign up and log into the [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderlabs.com/signup).

<div class="infoBlock">

**Why do I need to sign up for RudderStack?**

RudderStack's dashboard lets you easily set up your data pipelines by configuring your sources and destinations. It is fully hosted by RudderStack and is free for the users. You also get access to some important features like <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/">**Transformations**</a> and <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/user-guides/how-to-guides/live-destination-event-debugger/">**Live Events**</a>.
</div>

- Note and copy your workspace **Token** from the top of the page, as shown below. This will be required for setting up the data plane.

### Self-hosting the control plane

<div class="warning">
  
Use this option if you don't wish to sign up for RudderStack.
</div>

You can self-host your own control plane using the open-source [**Control Plane Lite**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/user-guides/how-to-guides/rudderstack-control-plane-lite/).

<div class="dangerBlock">

Note that the control plane set up using the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/user-guides/how-to-guides/rudderstack-control-plane-lite/">**Control Plane Lite**</a> utility lacks certain features like <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/">**Transformations**</a> and <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/user-guides/how-to-guides/live-destination-event-debugger/">**Live Events**</a>.
</div>

## Data plane setup

This section lists the steps to set up the RudderStack data plane in your preferred development environment.

### Prerequisites

To set up RudderStack, you will need to set up and install the following tools:

- [**Go 1.13**](https://golang.org/dl/) or above.
- [**Node.js 10.6**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or above.
- [**PostgreSQL 10**](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) or above

### For the RudderStack-hosted control plane

- First, set up the database in your preferred directory using the following commands:

```bash
createdb jobsdb
createuser --superuser rudder
psql "jobsdb" -c "alter user rudder with encrypted password 'rudder'";
psql "jobsdb" -c "grant all privileges on database jobsdb to rudder";
```

- Next, clone the [**RudderStack server**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server) repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server.git
```

- Then, run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` to fetch the `rudder-transformer` repository.

- Next, navigate to the Transformer directory using the following command:

```bash
cd rudder-transformer
```

- Install the dependencies using the command `npm i`. Then, start the destination transformer using the following command:

```bash
node destTransformer.js
```

- Navigate back to the main directory using the command `cd rudder-server`.

- Next, copy `sample.env` to the main directory using the following command:

```bash
cp config/sample.env .env
```

- Update the `WORKSPACE_TOKEN` environment variable in this file with the workspace token you copied from the RudderStack dashboard.

- Finally, run the RudderStack server using the following command:

```bash
go run -mod=vendor main.go
```

- Once you have completed these steps above successfully, [**send test events**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack/sending-test-events/) to verify the installation.

### For the self-hosted control plane

If you have self-hosted the control plane using the open-source <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/user-guides/how-to-guides/rudderstack-control-plane-lite/">**Control Plane Lite**</a> utility, follow [**these**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/control-plane-lite#developer-machine-setup) instructions to set up the RudderStack data plane in your development environment.

Once you have successfully followed the steps above, [**send test events**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack/sending-test-events/) to verify the installation.
