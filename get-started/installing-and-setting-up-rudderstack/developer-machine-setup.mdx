# Developer Machine Setup

This guide lists the steps required to set up RudderStack in your development environment.

## Introduction

Installing and setting up RudderStack involves two key steps:

- Control Plane setup
- Data Plane setup

<div class="infoBlock">

Refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/rudderstack-architecture">RudderStack Architecture</a> to know more about the RudderStack Control Plane and Data Plane.

</div>

## Control Plane Setup

There are two ways you can set up the Control Plane. This section lists the steps involved in each of them.

### **Use RudderStack-Hosted Control Plane**

- Sign up and log into the [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderlabs.com/signup).

<div class="infoBlock">

**Why do I need to sign up for RudderStack?**

RudderStack's dashboard lets you easily set up your data pipelines by configuring your sources and destinations. It is fully hosted by RudderStack and is free for open-source users. You also get access to some important features like <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/">Transformations</a> and a <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/user-guides/how-to-guides/live-destination-event-debugger/">Live Events</a> tab.

</div>

- Note and copy your workspace **Token** from the top of the page, as shown below. This will be required for setting up the Data Plane.

### Self-Host the Control Plane

<div class="warning">
Use this option if you don't wish to sign up for RudderStack.

</div>

You can self-host your own Control Plane using the open-source [**Control Plane Lite**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/user-guides/how-to-guides/rudderstack-control-plane-lite/).

<div class="dangerBlock">

Note that the Control Plane set up using the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/user-guides/how-to-guides/rudderstack-control-plane-lite/">Control Plane Lite</a> utility lacks certain features like <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/">Transformations</a> and <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/user-guides/how-to-guides/live-destination-event-debugger/">Live Events</a> tab.

</div>

## Data Plane Setup

This section lists the steps to set up the RudderStack Data Plane in your preferred development environment.

### Prerequisites

To set up RudderStack, you will need to set up and install the following tools:

- [**Go 1.13**](https://golang.org/dl/) or above.
- [**Node.js 10.6**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or above.
- [**PostgreSQL 10**](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) or above

### For **RudderStack-Hosted Control Plane**

- First, set up the database in your preferred directory using the following commands:

```bash
createdb jobsdb
createuser --superuser rudder
psql "jobsdb" -c "alter user rudder with encrypted password 'rudder'";
psql "jobsdb" -c "grant all privileges on database jobsdb to rudder";
```

- Next, clone the [**RudderStack server**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server) repository.
- Then, run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` to fetch the `rudder-transformer` repository.
- Next, navigate to the Transformer directory using the following command:

```bash
cd rudder-transformer
```

- Install dependencies using the command `npm i` . Then, start the destination transformer using the following command:

```bash
node destTransformer.js
```

- Navigate back to the main directory using the command `cd rudder-server`.
- Next, copy the `sample.env` to the main directory using the following command:

```bash
cp config/sample.env .env
```

- Update the`WORKSPACE_TOKEN` environment variable in this file with the workspace token you copied from the RudderStack dashboard.
- Finally, run the RudderStack server using the following command:

```bash
go run -mod=vendor main.go
```

- Once you have completed these steps above successfully, [**send test events**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack/sending-test-events/) to verify the installation.

### For **Self-Hosted Control Plane**

If you have self-hosted the Control Plane using the open-source <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/user-guides/how-to-guides/rudderstack-control-plane-lite/">Control Plane Lite</a> utility, follow [**these**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/control-plane-lite#developer-machine-setup) instructions to set up the RudderStack Data Plane in your development environment.

Once you have successfully followed the steps above, [**send test events**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack/sending-test-events/) to verify the installation.
