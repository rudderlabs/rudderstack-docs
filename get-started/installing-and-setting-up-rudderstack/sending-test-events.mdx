# Sending Test Events

<div class="infoBlock">

This guide assumes you have already <a href="/docs/get-started/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack">installed and set up RudderStack</a>.

</div>

There are two ways in which you can send test events to verify your RudderStack installation:

- Using the bundled shell script
- Using RudderStack's HTTP API

## Bundled Shell Script

In our [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server), we have bundled a shell script that generates test events. Follow the steps below:

### Clone the Repository

Before sending test events to verify your RudderStack installation, clone the RudderStack [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server) by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server.git
```

Then, follow the sections below to send events to test your RudderStack installation.

### Get the Source Write Key

#### **Option 1: If you have signed up for** [**RudderStack Cloud**](https://app.rudderstack.com/)**, follow these steps to get your source write key:**

- Set up a source and a destination in RudderStack by following this [**guide**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/).
- You can find the write key in the dashboard, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/screen-shot-2021-07-01-at-5.27.53-pm.png" />

<!-- <img src="../../assets/screen-shot-2021-07-01-at-5.27.53-pm.png" /> -->

<span class="imageTitle"></span>

<div class="warningBlock">

The **write key** is different from your **workspace token**. The write key is associated with the source, while the workspace token is associated with your RudderStack workspace.

</div>

#### **Option 2: If you are self-hosting RudderStack and have set up the control plane using the** [**Control Plane Lite**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/control-plane-lite/)**, you can find the source write key by following these steps:**

- Set up a source and a destination by following this [**guide**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/).
- You can find the write key associated with the source in the dashboard as shown:

<!-- <img src="../../assets/writekey.jpg)-->

<img src="../../assets/writekey.jpg" alt="Write Key" />

### Send Test Events

#### Option 1: If you're using RudderStack Cloud, follow these steps:

- In your terminal, navigate to the folder where RudderStack is installed.
- Then, run the following command after replacing `<YOUR_WRITE_KEY>` with the source write key obtained in the previous section:

```bash
./scripts/generate-event <YOUR_WRITE_KEY> https://hosted.rudderlabs.com/v1/batch
```

- You can then check your destination to verify that events are delivered. You can also view the live events via RudderStack's [**Live Events**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/user-guides/how-to-guides/live-destination-event-debugger/) tab.

#### Option 2: If you have set up open-source RudderStack in your environment, follow these steps:

- In your terminal, navigate to the folder where RudderStack is installed.
- Then, run the following command after replacing `<YOUR_WRITE_KEY>` with the source write key obtained in the previous section, and `<DATA_PLANE_URL>` with your Data Plane URL.

```bash
./scripts/generate-event <YOUR_WRITE_KEY> <DATA_PLANE_URL>/v1/batch
```

An example is as shown:

<!-- <img src="../../assets/test-event%20%281%29.jpg" /> -->

<img src="../../assets/test-event (1).jpg" alt="Test Event" />

- You can then check your destination to verify that the events are delivered.

<div class="infoBlock">

Note that unlike RudderStack Cloud, the Control Plane set up using the open-source <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/control-plane-lite/">Control Plane Lite</a> does not let you view live events.

</div>

If you supply an invalid source write key or Data Plane URL, you will get the following error:

## Using the HTTP API

- Import this [**Postman collection**](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/480307c55ad2b9dd4e27). 
- Edit the variables `source_write_key` and `data_plane_url` in this collection with your source write key and your RudderStack Data Plane URL.
- RudderStack uses Basic Authentication for authenticating all the HTTP requests. The HTTP Basic Authentication requires a user name and password where:
  - The user name is the `source_write_key`
  - The password is an empty string \(`""`\)
- Now you can test all the supported requests.

### Getting the Source Write Key

#### **If you have signed up for** [**RudderStack Cloud**](https://app.rudderstack.com/)**, follow these steps to get your source write key:**

- Set up a source in RudderStack by following this [**guide**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/).
- You can find the write key in the dashboard, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/screen-shot-2021-07-01-at-5.27.53-pm.png" />

#### **If you are self-hosting RudderStack and have set up the control plane using the** [**Control Plane Lite**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/control-plane-lite/) **utility, you can find the source write key by following these steps:**

- Set up a source by following this [**guide**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/).
- You can find the write key associated with the source in the dashboard as shown:

### Getting the Data Plane URL

<div class="infoBlock">

Follow <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack/#what-is-a-data-plane-url-where-do-i-get-it">this section</a> for details on how to get your Data Plane URL.

</div>
<div class="successBlock">
Refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/http-api/">HTTP API
guide</a> for more information on the supported calls.
