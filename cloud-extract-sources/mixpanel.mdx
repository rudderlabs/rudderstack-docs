# Mixpanel

[Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/) is an analytics platform that helps you to track user actions with your application. It also provides specific tools for targeted business communication and engagement with your customers. In-app A/B testing, user survey forms, and custom reports to measure customer retention are some of the other features offered by Mixpanel.

This document guides you in setting up Mixpanel as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Mixpanel data, which can then be routed to your data warehouse destination supported by RudderStack.

### Configuring the Source

- In the next screen, choose the **Start Date** under **Source Settings**. This is the date from which RudderStack ingests the data from Mixpanel.

### Setting the Data Update Schedule

- Next, you will be required to set the **Run Frequency** to schedule the data import from your Mixpanel account to RudderStack. You can also specify the time when you want this synchronization to start, by choosing the time under the **Sync Starting At** option, as shown:

That's it! Mixpanel is now successfully configured as a source on your RudderStack dashboard.

RudderStack will start importing data from your Mixpanel source as per the specified frequency. You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Connect Destinations** or **Add Destination**, as shown:

  Use the **Connect Destinations** option if you have already
  configured a data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data
  warehouse destination from scratch, click on the
  **Add Destination** button.

## FAQs

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

We have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
