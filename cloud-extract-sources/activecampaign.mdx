# ActiveCampaign Source

[ActiveCampaign](https://www.activecampaign.com/) is a popular marketing automation and CRM platform that lets you drive effective customer engagement and retention. With ActiveCampaign's all-in-one email marketing and growth platform, you can easily monitor your customers' product behavior and use the insights to design and drive highly personalized customer experiences.

This document guides you in setting up ActiveCampaign as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified ActiveCampaign data, which can then be routed to your RudderStack-supported data warehouse destination.

All the Cloud Extract sources support sending data only to a <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-warehouse-integrations/">data warehouse destination</a>.

2. Enter the following connection credentials to authenticate your ActiveCampaign account with RudderStack:
  - **Account Name**: Enter your ActiveCampaign account name. It can be found in your ActiveCampaign dashboard under **Settings** > **Account**.

### Destination settings

The following settings specify how RudderStack sends the data ingested from ActiveCampaign to the connected warehouse destination:

- **Table prefix**: RudderStack uses this prefix to create a table in your data warehouse and loads all your ActiveCampaign data into it.
- **Schedule Settings**: RudderStack gives you three options to ingest the data from ActiveCampaign:
    - **Basic**: Runs the syncs at the specified time interval. 
    - **CRON**: Runs the syncs based on the user-defined CRON expression.
    - **Manual**: You are required to run the syncs manually.

### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?
