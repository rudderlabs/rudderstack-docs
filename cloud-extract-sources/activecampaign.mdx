# ActiveCampaign Source

[ActiveCampaign](https://www.activecampaign.com/) is a popular marketing automation and CRM platform that lets you drive effective customer engagement and retention. With ActiveCampaign's all-in-one email marketing and growth platform, you can easily monitor your customers' product behavior and use the insights to design and drive highly personalized customer experiences.

This document guides you in setting up ActiveCampaign as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified ActiveCampaign data, which can then be routed to your RudderStack-supported data warehouse destination.

## Getting started

2. Go to **Sources** > **New source** > **Cloud Extract** and select **ActiveCampaign** from the list of sources.
3. Assign a name to your source and click on **Next**.

### Setting the Table Prefix, Run Frequency and Data Update Schedule

- Next, you will be required to set the **Table Prefix**. RudderStack will create a table in your warehouse with this prefix name and load all your ActiveCampaign data into it.
- Also, set the **Run Frequency** to schedule the data import from your ActiveCampaign account to RudderStack. Optionally, you can also specify the time when you want this synchronization to start, by choosing the time under the **Sync Starting At** option.

That's it! ActiveCampaign is now successfully configured as a source on your RudderStack dashboard.

RudderStack will start ingesting data from ActiveCampaign as per the specified frequency. You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Connect Destinations** or **Add Destinations**, as shown:

<div class="successBlock">

  Use the **Connect Destinations** option if you have already
  configured a data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data
  warehouse destination from scratch, click on the
  **Add Destination** button.

## FAQ

### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
