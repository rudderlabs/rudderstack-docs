# Xero

[Xero](https://www.xero.com/us/) is a popular cloud-based accounting software, ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, accountants, and book-keepers. It allows you to simplify your accounting and everyday business-related tasks, including bill payments, bank connections, and claiming expenses.

This document guides you in setting up Xero as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Xero data, which can then be routed to your data warehouse destination supported by RudderStack.

**All the Cloud Extract sources support sending data only to a data warehouse destination.**

## Getting Started

To add Xero as a source in RudderStack, follow these steps:

- Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderlabs.com/signup?type=freetrial).
- From the left panel, select **Sources**. Then, click on **Add Source**, as shown:

### Configuring the Source

- In the next screen, choose the Xero **Tenant ID** . Also, select the **Earliest Report Year** and **Report Starting Month** from which you want RudderStack to ingest the data.

### Setting the Data Update Schedule

- Next, you will be required to set the **Run Frequency** to schedule the data import from your Xero account to RudderStack. You can also specify the time when you want this synchronization to start, by choosing the time under the **Sync Starting At** option, as shown:

### Selecting the Data to Import

- Finally, select the appropriate data columns to import. To import all the data, simply click on **Select All**.

That's it! Xero is now successfully configured as a source on your RudderStack dashboard.

RudderStack will start importing data from Xero as per the specified frequency. You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Connect Destinations** or **Add Destinations**, as shown:

<div class="successBlock">

  Use the **Connect Destinations** option if you have already
  configured a data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data
  warehouse destination from scratch, click on the
  **Add Destination** button.

## FAQs

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

We have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
