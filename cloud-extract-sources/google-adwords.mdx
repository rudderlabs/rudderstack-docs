# Google AdWords

[Google AdWords](https://ads.google.com/intl/en_in/home/) is Google's premier online advertising platform that lets advertisers display their advertisements, service offerings, and product listings to prospective customers. 

This document guides you in setting up Google AdWords as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Google AdWords data and routes it to the supported data warehouse destinations.

All the Cloud Extract sources support sending data only to a <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-warehouse-integrations/">warehouse destination</a>.

## FAQ

### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is. RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different prefixes.
