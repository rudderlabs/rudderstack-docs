# Google AdWords

[Google AdWords](https://ads.google.com/intl/en_in/home/) is Google's premier online advertising platform. It allows advertisers to display their advertisements, as well as service offerings and product listings to prospective customers. With AdWords, you can place your ads within Google's search results, and also on your websites, mobile apps and videos. Google Adwords offers these advertisement services under a PPC \(pay per click\) model.

This document guides you in setting up Google AdWords as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Google AdWords data, which can then be routed to your data warehouse destination supported by RudderStack.

**All the Cloud Extract sources support sending data only to a data warehouse destination.**

<div class="infoBlock">

If you have already connected RudderStack to your Google AdWords account, your credentials should appear automatically under **Use existing credentials**.

</div>

### Configuring the Source Settings

- After successfully connecting RudderStack to your Google AdWords account, the customer IDs associated with this account will automatically appear in the dropdown menu of the **Customer ID**, where you can select one. You also need to select a **Start Date** for your pipeline, which specifies the earliest date that RudderStack will start importing your AdWords data from.

<!--<img src="../../../images/assets/screen-shot-2020-12-17-at-4.40.01-pm.png" />-->

<img
  src="../../../images/assets/screen-shot-2020-12-17-at-4.40.01-pm.png"
  alt="Customer ID"
/>

<div class="infoBlock">

Please note that this **Start date** is valid only for the first (historical) sync.

</div>

### Setting the Data Update Schedule

- Next, you will be required to set the **Run Frequency** to schedule the data import from your Google AdWords account to RudderStack. You can also specify the time when you want this synchronization to start, by choosing the time under the **Sync Starting At** option.

<!--<img src="../../../images/assets/screen-shot-2020-12-17-at-4.40.48-pm.png" />-->

### Specifying the Data to Sync

  alt="Specifying the data to sync"

That's it! Google AdWords is now successfully configured as a source on your RudderStack dashboard.

RudderStack will start importing data from Google AdWords as per the specified frequency. You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Connect Destinations** or **Add Destinations**, as shown:

## FAQs

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

We have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
