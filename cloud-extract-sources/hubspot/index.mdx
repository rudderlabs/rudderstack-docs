# HubSpot

[HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/) is a leading marketing and sales platform that helps you track leads, as well as inbound marketing and sales. It offers state-of-the-art tools for efficient marketing, tracking sales, and offering better customer support.

This document guides you in setting up HubSpot as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified HubSpot data, which can then be routed to your data warehouse destination supported by RudderStack.

If you've already configured HubSpot as a source before, you can choose the account visible under the **Use existing credentials** tab.

### Setting the Table Prefix, Run Frequency and Data Update Schedule

- Next, you will be required to set the **Table Prefix**. RudderStack will create a table in your warehouse with this prefix name and load all your HubSpot data into it.
- Also, set the **Run Frequency** to schedule the data import from your HubSpot account to RudderStack. Optionally, you can also specify the time when you want this synchronization to start, by choosing the time under the **Sync Starting At** option.

### Selecting the Data to Import

- Finally, choose the HubSpot data that you wish to ingest via RudderStack. You can either select all the data, or choose specific HubSpot data attributes, as per your requirement.

That's it! HubSpot is now successfully configured as a source on your RudderStack dashboard.

RudderStack will start ingesting data from HubSpot as per the specified frequency. You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Connect Destinations** or **Add Destination**, as shown:

<!--<img src="../../assets/7 (9).png" />-->

Use the **Connect Destinations** option if you have already configured a data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data warehouse destination from scratch, click on the **Add Destination** button.

## FAQs

#### How does RudderStack sync the HubSpot data?

* When RudderStack first connects to your HubSpot data source, it pulls all of your historical data. 
* Then, it syncs the HubSpot data based on the specified on the **Run Frequency** set by you in the RudderStack dashboard. The default setting is set to 30 minutes. 
* There may be instances where an incremental sync is not possible due to HubSpot's API limitations. In such cases, a full sync is done.

#### How does RudderStack handle custom HubSpot fields?

RudderStack creates a column for any custom HubSpot fields and syncs it to your warehouse destination accordingly.

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is. 

We have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
