# NetSuite

[**NetSuite**](https://www.netsuite.com/portal/home.shtml) is a popular business management suite, delivering ERP, CRM, and eCommerce solutions to nearly 25000 customers worldwide. With NetSuite, you get a unified, real-time business management platform to manage all your ERP, automation, analytics, and marketing operations effortlessly, and at a fraction of a cost of the traditional on-premise ERP tools.

This guide will help you set up NetSuite as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified NetSuite data, which can then be routed to your data warehouse destination via RudderStack.

## Configuring NetSuite

### IP whitelisting

Depending on the setup of your NetSuite organization you might have to whitelist some RudderStack IP addresses. These IPs are:

**3.216.35.97 \| 34.198.90.241 \| 54.147.40.62 \| 23.20.96.9 \| 18.214.35.254**

To whitelist the IPs on NetSuite do the following.

1. Sign into your NetSuite account as an administrator.
2. In your NetSuite account, click **Setup &gt; Company &gt; Company** **Information**.
3. In the **Allowed IP addresses** field, add a **comma-delimited** list of the RudderStack IPs mentioned above.
4. Click **Save**.

### Enabling token-based authentication

Next, you will have to enable token-based authentication for your NetSuite account. This is required to generate tokens and authenticate to the [**SuiteTalk API**](https://www.netsuite.com/portal/developers/resources/suitetalk-documentation.shtml).

1. On the **Enable Features** page, locate the **Manage Authentication** section. This should be after the **SuiteTalk** section.
2. Check the **Token-based Authentication** box.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Save**.

Your settings should look like the following image:

<!--![](../.gitbook/assets/5.-consumer-key-secret.png)-->

<img src="../assets/5.-consumer-key-secret.png" alt="Token based Authentication" />

### Creating an integration

Next, you will need to create an integration record for RudderStack. This will uniquely identify RudderStack in your NetSuite account. Follow these steps:

1. Using the global search, type `page: integrations` and click the **Page: Manage Integrations** result.
2. On the **Integrations** page, click the **New** button.
3. On the **New Integration** page, fill in the following fields: - **Name**: Enter a name for the integration. - **State**: Select **Enabled**.
4. In the **Authentication** tab, select the **Token-based Authentication** option.
5. Click the **Save** button. The confirmation page will display a **Consumer key/secret** section.
6. **Copy the Consumer Key and Secret somewhere handy.** You’ll need these credentials to complete the setup in RudderStack.

### Creating a NetSuite role and configuring permissions

To create a NetSuite Token ID and Token Secret, you first need to create a **Role** for RudderStack and an **Employee** that has this specific role.

#### Step 1: Creating a role

1. Using the global search, type `page: new role` and click the **Page: New Role** result.
2. On the Role page, enter a name for the role in the **Name** field \(e.g. RudderStack\).
3. Select **Two-factor Authentication Required** to **Not Required**.

<!--![](../.gitbook/assets/role.png)-->

<img src="../assets/role.png" alt="Two factor authentication" />

Then, under the **Permissions** section, go to **Setup** and assign the following permissions:

Assign **Full** permissions for the following:

* Web Services
* User Access Tokens
* Log In Using Access Tokens
* Deleted Records

Assign **View** permissions for the following:

* Custom Fields
* Custom Body Fields
* Perform Search \(you can find this under the **Lists** section next to **Setup**\)

<!--![](../.gitbook/assets/role-permissions.png)-->

<img src="../assets/role-permissions.png" alt="Lists" />

<div class="infoBlock">

For each pipeline resource that you want RudderStack to sync, you should give the relevant permissions for it to the Role. These resources are divided among these sections - **Transactions**, **Reports**, **Lists**, and **Custom Records**. Note that each permission should have **View** permissions.
</div>

<div class="warningBlock">

It is extremely important that you have assigned the permissions for every resource, saved search or custom record that you want RudderStack to sync. This is required so that you don't encounter any RudderStack sync failures with permission-related issues.
</div>

#### Step 2: Creating an employee

To create an employee, navigate to **Lists - Employees - Employees - New**. Then, enter the name and email ID of the employee. Under the **Access** section, select **Give Access**, and **Manually assign or change password**. Proceed to add a password. Finally, add the **Role** which you have created in the previous step. Click on **Save** to save the settings.

<!--![](../.gitbook/assets/employee.png)-->

<img src="../assets/employee.png" alt="Role" />

#### Step 3: Creating an access token

In this step, you’ll generate access tokens for the integration record \(application\) and user role. You may need to first login as this user to properly generate the **Access Token**.

1. Using the global search, type `page: tokens` and click the **Page: Access Tokens** result.
2. Click the **New Access Token** button.
3. On the **Access Token** page, fill in the following fields: - **Application Name**: Select the integration record you created. - **User**: Select the  user you created. - **Role**: Select the role you created. - **Token Name**: Enter a name for the token.
4. Click the **Save** button. The confirmation page will display a **Token ID and Secret**. Note: For security reasons, this is the only time they will be displayed.
5. **Copy the Token ID and Secret somewhere handy**. You’ll need these credentials to complete the setup.
6. You can now mark the Role as a **Web Services Only Role** by selecting the checkbox in the **Manage Roles** page.

<!--![](../.gitbook/assets/8%20%283%29.png)-->

### Locating your NetSuite Account ID

1. Using the global search, type `page: web services` and click the **Page: Web Services Preferences** result.
2. In the Primary Information section, locate the **Account ID** field as shown in the image on the right.

**Note:** If your Account ID contains a suffix - `1234567_SB2`, for example - it should be included when entering the ID into RudderStack.

## FAQs

### How can I get the RudderStack Restlet URL?

<div class="warningBlock">

To get the RudderStack Restlet URL, you need to first install [**this script**](https://js.blendo.co/netsuite/v1/restlet.js) in your NetSuite account, and paste the generated Restlet URL in the RudderStack Restlet URL field.
</div>

To create a new **Script** in your NetSuite account, navigate to **Customization** - **Scripting** - **Scripts** - **New**. Then, click on the **+** icon to create a new script. A new window will then pop up, asking you to select the downloaded [**script**](https://js.blendo.co/NetSuite/v1/restlet.js). Once you have attached it, click on **Save**, and then click **Create Script Record**.

<!--![](../.gitbook/assets/11.-new-script.png)-->

<img src="../assets/11.-new-script.png" alt="Create Script Record" />

Then add the **Name** of the script and the **Owner**, that is the **Employee** that you have created before \(in **Step 2** of the FAQ **How can I get the NetSuite Token ID and Token Secret?**\). Then click on **Save**.

<!--![](../.gitbook/assets/12.-save-script.png)-->

<img src="../assets/12.-save-script.png" alt="Save" />

Then, you need to deploy the script. In order to do so, click on **Deployments**, add the script **Title** and click on **Add**. After the script is deployed, click on **Save**.

<!--![](../.gitbook/assets/13.-script-deployment.png)-->

<img src="../assets/13.-script-deployment.png" alt="Save" />

### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

We have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
