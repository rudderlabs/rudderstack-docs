# NetSuite

[NetSuite](https://www.netsuite.com/portal/home.shtml) is a popular business management suite that delivers efficient ERP, CRM, and other e-commerce solutions to nearly 25000 customers worldwide.

This document guides you in setting up Sendgrid as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Sendgrid data, which can then be routed to your RudderStack-supported data warehouse destination.

<div class="warningBlock">

All the Cloud Extract sources support sending data only to a <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/data-warehouse-integrations/">data warehouse destination</a>.
</div>

## Configuring NetSuite

Before you set up a Netsuite source in RudderStack, there are some RudderStack-specific configurations you need to do in your Netsuite account.

### Whitelisting the IPs

Depending on the setup of your NetSuite organization, you will have to whitelist the following RudderStack IPs:

- 3.216.35.97
- 34.198.90.241
- 54.147.40.62
- 23.20.96.9
- 18.214.35.254

To whitelist the IPs in NetSuite, follow these steps:

1. Sign into your NetSuite account as an administrator.
2. Go to **Setup** > **Company** > **Company Information**.
3. Add a comma-delimited list of the above-mentioned RudderStack IPs in the **Allowed IP addresses** field.
4. Finally, click on **Save**.

### Enabling token-based authentication

You will also be required to enable token-based authentication for your NetSuite account in order to generate tokens and authenticate the [SuiteTalk API](https://www.netsuite.com/portal/developers/resources/suitetalk-documentation.shtml).

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Locate the **Manage Authentication** option in the **Enable Features** page.
2. Enable (check) the **Token-based Authentication** box.
3. Finally, scroll to the bottom and click on **Save**.

### Creating an integration

Next, create an integration record for RudderStack to uniquely identify RudderStack in your NetSuite account.

<img src="../assets/cloud-extract/netsuite-settings-2.png" alt="New integration in Netsuite" />

Follow these steps to create a new integration:

1. Go to **Setup** > **Integration** > **Manage Integrations** > **New**.
2. In the **New Integration** page, enter the following fields:
    - **Name**: Enter a name for your integration.
    - **State**: This field should be **Enabled**.
3. In the **Authentication** tab, enable (check) **Token-based Authentication**.
4. Finally, click on the **Save** button. The confirmation page will display a **Consumer key/secret** section, as shown:

<img src="../assets/cloud-extract/netsuite-settings-3.png" alt="Consume key/token in Netsuite" />

<div class="warningBlock">

<strong>Safely store the consumer key and secret</strong>. You will need these credentials while setting up the NetSuite source in RudderStack.
</div>

### Creating a NetSuite role and configuring permissions

To create a NetSuite Token ID and Secret, you first need to create a **Role** for RudderStack and an **Employee** with this specific role.

#### Step 1: Creating a role

To create a new role, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Setup** > **Users/Roles** > **Manage Roles** > **New**.
2. Enter a name for the role in the **Name** field, for example, `RudderStack`.
3. Select **Two-Factor Authentication Required** to **Not Required**.

<img src="../assets/cloud-extract/netsuite-settings-4.png" alt="2FA Authentication in Netsuite" />

4. Under the **Permissions** section, go to **Setup** and assign the following permissions:

| Full permissions | View permissions |
| :---- | :----- |
| Web Services | Custom Fields |
| User Access Tokens | Custom Body Fields
| Log In Using Access Tokens | Perform Search (this can be found in the **Lists** section next to **Setup**)
| Deleted Records | - |

<img src="../assets/cloud-extract/netsuite-settings-5.png" alt="Permissions in Netsuite" />

For each pipeline resource that you want RudderStack to sync, you should give the relevant permissions for it to the role. These resources are divided among the following sections:

- **Transactions**
- **Reports**
- **Lists**, and 
- **Custom Records**. 

Note that each permission should have **View** level.

<div class="warningBlock">

It is extremely important that you have assigned the permissions for every resource, saved search or custom record that you want RudderStack to sync. This is required so that you don't encounter any RudderStack sync failures with permission-related issues.
</div>

#### Step 2: Creating an employee

To create a new employee, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Lists** > **Employees** > **Employees** > **New**.
2. Then, enter the name and email ID of the employee.
3. Under the **Access** section, enable (check) **Give Access** and **Manually assign or change password**. Then add the required password.
4. Finally, add the **Role** which you have created in the previous step and click on **Save** to save the settings.

<img src="../assets/cloud-extract/netsuite-settings-6.png" alt="Adding an employee in Netsuite" />

#### Step 3: Creating an access token

In this step, you will need to generate the access tokens required for the integration record \(application\) and the user role.

<div class="infoBlock">

To generate the access token, you may have to first log in as this user.
</div>

<img src="../assets/cloud-extract/netsuite-settings-7.png" alt="Access token settings in Netsuite" />

1. Go to **Setup** > **Users/Roles** > **Access Tokens** > **New**.
2. Then, enter the following settings:
    - **Application Name**: Select the integration record you created.
    - **User**: Select the user you created.
    - **Role**: Select the role you created.
    - **Token Name**: Assign a name for the token.
3. Finally, click on the **Save** button. The confirmation page will display a **Token ID and Secret**, as shown:

<div class="warningBlock">

For security reasons, this is the only time these credentials will be displayed. Hence, copy and store the <strong>Token ID</strong> and <strong>Token Secret</strong> safely. You will need these credentials while setting up the NetSuite source in RudderStack.
</div>

<img src="../assets/cloud-extract/netsuite-settings-8.png" alt="Access token settings in Netsuite" />

### Locating your NetSuite Account ID

To locate your NetSuite account ID, go to **Setup** > **Integration** > **Web Services Preferences**.

You will find the account ID in the resulting page, as highlighted below:

<img src="../assets/cloud-extract/netsuite-settings-9.png" alt="Account ID in Netsuite" />

<div class="warningBlock">
  
If your Account ID contains a suffix, for example, <code class="inline-code">1234567_SB2</code>, it should be included when you enter the ID during the source configuration in RudderStack.
</div>

</div>

### Destination settings

The following settings specify how RudderStack sends the data ingested from NetSuite to the connected warehouse destination:

- **Table prefix**: RudderStack uses this prefix to create a table in your data warehouse and loads all your NetSuite data into it.
- **Schedule Settings**: RudderStack gives you three options to ingest the data from NetSuite:
    - **Basic**: Runs the syncs at the specified time interval. 
    - **CRON**: Runs the syncs based on the user-defined CRON expression.
    - **Manual**: You are required to run the syncs manually.

<div class="infoBlock">

#### Importing custom records and saved searches

RudderStack supports two special types of resources that you can ingest from NetSuite, namely **custom records** and **saved searches**.  To import these resources, click on **Add Resource** on the top right, as shown above. You will see the following window:

<img src="../assets/cloud-extract/netsuite-settings-13.png" alt="Cloning resources" />

* If you have already configured a NetSuite resource before, you can choose the **Clone from** option to use the values of that resource as is.
* Alternatively, select the appropriate **Resource type** you want to import:  
  * For a **saved_search**, enter a **Name** for the resource, select the **Record type** present in your NetSuite account, and the exact **Saved search** that you have created there.
  * For a **custom_record**, enter a **Name** for the resource and select the custom record that is present on your NetSuite account.  
* Finally, save the information by clicking on **Save**.


NetSuite is now configured as a source. RudderStack will start ingesting data from NetSuite as per your specified schedule and frequency.

You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Add Destination**, as shown:

<img src="../assets/cloud-extract-sources/add-destination.png" alt="Adding a destination" />

<div class="successBlock">

### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
