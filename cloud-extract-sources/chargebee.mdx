# Chargebee

[**Chargebee**](https://www.Chargebee.com/) is a subscription billing and revenue management platform. It lets you streamline your revenue operations via features like subscription workflow automation, cutting-edge revenue reporting, and more. 

This document guides you in setting up Chargebee as a source in RudderStack. Once configured, RudderStack automatically ingests your specified Chargebee data, which can then be routed to your RudderStack-supported data warehouse destination.

- Add the following Chargebee credentials:

   -  **Site**: Enter your Chargebee site name.

   - **API Key**: Enter your Chargebee API key. For more information on where to find the Chargebee API key, refer to their [**documentation**](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/api_keys.html).

   - **Start Date**: Enter the date from which RudderStack will import all your historical Chargebee data.

   - **Product Catalog**: Select your Chargebee Product Catalog version from the dropdown. For more information on the Product Catalog, refer to the [**Chargebee documentation**](https://www.chargebee.com/docs/2.0/product-catalog.html).

- Under **Destination Settings**, set the **Table prefix**. RudderStack will create a table in your data warehouse with this prefix name and load all your Chargebee data into it.

- Under **Schedule Settings**, set the **Run Frequency**. This option specifies how frequently the syncs will occur.

- Optionally, you can also specify the time of the sync by selecting the time under **Sync Starting At**. Then, click on **Next**.

<div class="successBlock">

  Select the <strong>Use Existing Destination</strong> option if you have already configured a <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/data-warehouse-integrations/">data warehouse destination</a> in RudderStack. To configure a warehouse destination from scratch, click on the <strong>Create New Destination</strong> button.

## FAQs

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
