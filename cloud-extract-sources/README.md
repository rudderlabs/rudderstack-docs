# RudderStack Cloud Extract Sources

## What are Sources in RudderStack?

Sources are the tools or platforms from which the event data can be ingested into RudderStack. This event data can then be routed \(with or without transformation\) into your data warehouse or preferred destinations for analytics or other activation use-cases.

## RudderStack Cloud Extract

With RudderStack Cloud Extract, you can collect your raw events and data from different cloud tools such as [Facebook Ads](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads), [Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/), [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/), [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome), [Marketo](https://www.marketo.com/), [HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/), and more.  
  
The raw data from RudderStack Cloud Extract can then be routed to your preferred data warehouses \(Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, ClickHouse, and PostgreSQL\) for further analysis.
