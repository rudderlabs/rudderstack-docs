# Google Sheets

[Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) is a popular spreadsheet program that is bundled as a part of the free, cloud-based office suite offered by Google. With Google Sheets you can seamlessly create spreadsheets that update and save automatically and are easy to access from your Google Drive.

With the RudderStack-Google Sheets integration, you can send your spreadsheet data residing within Google Sheets to your preferred data warehouse destination supported by RudderStack.

**All the Cloud Extract sources support sending data only to a data warehouse destination.**

## Getting Started

Setting up the Google Sheet integration with RudderStack involves three major steps:

1. Specifying the connection credentials to integrate Google Sheets with RudderStack
2. Defining the Google Sheet and the workbook which will act as the source of data
3. Setting the data update schedule

To set up Google Sheets as a source on the RudderStack dashboard, follow these steps:

- Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderlabs.com/signup?type=freetrial).
- From the left panel, select **Sources**. Then, click on **Add Source**, as shown:

<!--<img src="../../../assets/image (97) (1) (1) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (3) (3).png" />-->

<img
  src="../assets/image (97) (1) (1) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (3).png"
  alt="Add Source"
/>

- Next, select **Google Sheets**, and click on **Next**.

<!-- <img src="../../../images/1 (7).png" />-->

<img src="../assets/1 (7).png" alt="Google Sheets" />

- Assign a name to your source, and click on **Next**.

<!--<img src="../../../assets/2 (2).png" />-->

<img src="../assets/2 (2).png" alt="Assign a name" />

### Specifying Connection Credentials

- Next, click on **Connect with Google Sheets**. Choose your Google account and give RudderStack the required permissions to access Google Sheets.

<div class="infoBlock">

If you've already configured Google Sheets as a source before, you can choose the Google account under the **Use existing credentials** tab.

</div>

### Defining the Data Source

- Next, choose the Google Spreadsheet and the worksheet to be used as the data source. You will also need to specify the **Header row**. This is the row that contains the sheet’s headers and column names.

<div class="infoBlock">

By default, RudderStack uses the first row of the sheet as the header row.

</div>

<!--<img src="../../../assets/4.png" />-->

<img src="../assets/4.png" alt="First data row" />

- You will also need to specify the **First data row**. This is the row where the sheet’s data begins. Then, click on **Next** to proceed.

<div class="infoBlock">

By default, RudderStack uses the row that follows the header as the first data row.

</div>

- RudderStack will automatically verify if the sheet is valid and contains any data. If the specified worksheet is empty, RudderStack will flag this automatically, as shown:

<!--<img src="../assets/7 (1).png" />-->

<img src="../assets/7 (1).png" alt="Verifying the data" />

### Setting the Data Update Schedule

- As the final step, you will be required to set the **Run Frequency** to schedule the data import from your Google Sheet to RudderStack. You can also specify the time when you want this synchronization to start, by choosing the time under the **Sync Starting At** option.

<!--<img src="../assets/5 (4).png" />-->

<img src="../assets/5 (4).png" alt="Run Frequency" />

That's it! Your Google Sheet is now successfully configured as a source.

RudderStack will start ingesting data from your Google Sheets source as per the specified frequency. You can further connect this source to your data warehouse by clicking on **Connect Destinations** or **Add Destination**, as shown:

<!--<img src="../assets/6 (5).png" />-->

<img src="../assets/6 (5).png" alt="Connect Destinations" />

<div class="successBlock">

  Use the **Connect Destinations** option if you have already
  configured a data warehouse destination in RudderStack. To configure a data
  warehouse destination from scratch, click on the **Add Destination** button.
</div>

## FAQs

#### Is it possible to have multiple Cloud Extract sources writing to the same schema?

Yes, it is.

We have implemented a feature wherein RudderStack associates a table prefix for every Cloud Extract source writing to a warehouse schema. This way, multiple Cloud Extract sources can write to the same schema with different table prefixes.
