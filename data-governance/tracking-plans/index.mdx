# Tracking Plans

Tracking Plans let you proactively monitor and act on non-compliant event data coming into your RudderStack sources based on predefined plans. This can help you prevent or de-risk situations where missing or improperly configured event data can break your downstream destinations.

<div class="warningBlock">
  

The Tracking Plans currently support only the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/track/"><code class="inline-code">track</code></a> events sent to the <strong>warehouse destinations</strong>.
</div>

## Tracking Plan features

With the help of a Tracking Plan, you can:

* Define specific event names and properties for each of your `track`, `group`, and `identify` calls.
* Specify whether a property/attribute is required and assign a particular data type.
* Have better control of your data streaming by supporting a versioning system.
* Use the [Data Governance API](https://rudderstack.com/docs/data-governance/rudderstack-data-governance-api/) to evaluate your inbound events and metadata, and compare them with your plans.
