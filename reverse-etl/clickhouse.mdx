# ClickHouse

[ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.tech/) is an open-source, column-oriented database management system mainly used for online analytical processing \(OLAP\). It lets you generate analytical reports that are updated in real-time using SQL queries. ClickHouse is highly scalable, fast, and built for high performance.

RudderStack supports ClickHouse as a source from which you can ingest data and route it to your desired downstream destinations.

## Setting up the ClickHouse source in RudderStack

To set up ClickHouse as a source in RudderStack, follow these steps:

### Naming the source

1. Log into your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/).
2. From the left panel, go to **Source** > **New Source** > **Reverse ETL**.  Then, select **ClickHouse**, as shown:

3. Assign a name to your source.

### Configuring the connection credentials

1. Enter the relevant settings in the **Connection Credentials** section as listed below:

- **Host** - Enter the host name of your ClickHouse service.
- **Port** - Enter the port number of your ClickHouse service.
- **Database** - Enter the database name in your ClickHouse instance from where the data is to be imported.
- **User** - Enter the name of the user having the required read/write access to the above database.
- **Password** - Enter the password for the above user.
- **Secure** - Enabling this setting establishes a secure connection and displays additional settings as shown below:

  - **Skip Verify** - Skips certificate verification. Enable this setting if you are using self-signed certificates.
  - **CA certificate** -  Certificate contents of the certificate which needs to be verified while establishing a secure connection.

If you've configured ClickHouse as a source before, you can select the existing credentials from <strong>Use existing credentials</strong> option.

2. Click on **Continue** to proceed.

### Schedule settings

1. Specify the **Schedule Settings** to schedule the data syncs from your ClickHouse instance.

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack lets you schedule data syncs for your Reverse ETL sources and specify how and when the syncs will run. For more information on the <strong>Basic</strong>, <strong>CRON</strong>, and <strong>Manual</strong> schedule types, refer to the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/reverse-etl/common-settings/sync-schedule-settings/">Sync Schedule Settings</a> guide.
</div>

2. After specifying the schedule type and run settings, click on **Continue** to finish the setup.

ClickHouse is now successfully configured as a source in your RudderStack dashboard. You can further connect this source to your preferred destination by clicking on **Add Destination** button, as shown:

<img src="../assets/warehouse-actions-sources/destination.png" alt="Add destination in RudderStack" />

<div class="infoBlock">
  
If you have already configured a destination in RudderStack, choose the <strong>Use Existing Destination</strong> option which will take you to the <strong>Schema</strong> tab in the source settings. To add a new destination from scratch, select the <strong>Create New Destination</strong> option which will take you to the destination configuration page.
</div>

## Specifying the data to import

While connecting a destination to your Reverse ETL source, you can use the default JSON mapping or the [Visual Data Mapping](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/reverse-etl/features/visual-data-mapper/) feature.
