</div>

## Getting started

Before configuring AppsFlyer as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by AppsFlyer by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | -             | **Supported** | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between the cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</a> guide.
</div>

<div class="successBlock">

We recommend using the the cloud mode to send events to AppsFlyer in the following scenarios:
<ul>
<li>If you want to use RudderStack's <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/">Transformations</a> feature</li> 
<li>If you want to send server-side events</li>
</ul>
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the platform supports sending events to AppsFlyer, perform the steps below:

- From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **AppsFlyer**.

<div class="infoBlock">

Refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/">Adding a Source and Destination in RudderStack</a> guide for more information.
</div>

- Assign a name to the destination and click on **Next**. You should then see the following screen:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/appsflyer-connection-settings-final.png" alt="AppsFlyer connection settings in RudderStack" />

### Connection settings

The following connection settings are required to configure AppsFlyer as a destination in RudderStack:

- **AppsFlyer Dev Key**: Enter your AppsFlyer Dev key here.

<div class="infoBlock">

Refer to the <a href="#faqs">FAQs</a> section below for more information on obtaining the AppsFlyer dev key.
</div>

- **Sharing Filter**: By default, the value for this setting is set to `all`. 

<div class="infoBlock">

## Connecting AppsFlyer to non-Android/iOS sources

AppsFlyer supports all the RudderStack sources in addition to Android and iOS. However, you will need to add a transformation to the destination by following these steps:

- Go to your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/).

- In the left navigation bar, select **Transformations** followed by **New transformation**. 

- In the **Transformation Settings** window, assign a **Name** and **Description** for the transformation.

- Then, add the following function:

```javascript
export function transformEvent(event, metadata) {
  event.context.os = {
    name: "android",
    version: "8.1.0"
  };
  return event;
}
```

- Click on **Save** to save the transformation.

- Finally, configure your AppsFlyer destination and connect it to the transformation in the **Choose an existing transformation** window, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/appsflyer-2.png" alt="AppsFlyer transformation settings in RudderStack" />

- If you have already configured your AppsFlyer destination, navigate to the **Transformation** option, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/appsflyer-3.png" alt="Transformation settings after adding destination" />

- Click on **Add a transformation** and select the transformation you created above.

## Sending events via the RudderStack cloud mode

<div class="warningBlock">

We recommend sending events to AppsFlyer via the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode">cloud mode</a> only in the following two scenarios:
<ul>
<li>To use RudderStack's <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/transformations/">Transformations</a> feature to transform your events</li> 
<li>To send server-side events</li>
</ul>
</div>

To send events to AppsFlyer, you need the AppsFlyer ID generated by the Appsflyer SDK that is integrated with your app.

<div class="warningBlock">

Refer to the <a href="#obtaining-the-appsflyer-id">Obtaining the AppsFlyer ID</a> section below for more information.
</div>

Once you obtain the AppsFlyer ID, you can send events to AppsFlyer via the cloud mode by including the `externalId` key within your events' `context`. The format of `externalId` is as shown:

```javascript
"externalId": [
  {
    "id": "AppsFlyer_ID",
    "type": "appsflyerExternalId"
  }
]
```

The following table lists the `externalId` fields:

| Field | Description|
| :----| :------------|
| `id` | Your AppsFlyer ID. |
| `type`| The type of `externalId`. This must always be set to `appsFlyerExternalId`. |

### Obtaining the AppsFlyer ID

As mentioned above, the AppsFlyer ID is generated by the Appsflyer SDK integrated with your app.

- If the AppsFlyer SDK is directly loaded on your app, refer to this [**AppsFlyer documentation**](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/207034486-Server-to-server-events-API-for-mobile-S2S-mobile-#fetching-the-appsflyer-id) to obtain the AppsFlyer ID.

- If your AppsFlyer SDK is loaded through RudderStack (device mode integration), then you can obtain the AppsFlyer ID by including the code snippet in your app, depending on your platform of integration:

<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>iOS</Tab>
    <Tab>Android</Tab>
    <Tab>React Native</Tab>
  </TabList>
    <TabPanels>
      <TabPanel>
<span>

```objectivec
#import <AppsFlyerLib/AppsFlyerLib.h>
NSString *appsflyerId = [AppsFlyerLib shared].getAppsFlyerUID;
```
</span>
      </TabPanel>
      <TabPanel>
<span>

```java
import com.appsflyer.AppsFlyerLib;
String appsFlyerId = AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().getAppsFlyerUID(this);
```
</span>
      </TabPanel>
      <TabPanel>
<span>

```javascript
import AppsFlyerIntegrationFactory from "@rudderstack/rudder-integration-appsflyer-react-native/src/bridge"
const appsFlyerId = await AppsFlyerIntegrationFactory.getAppsFlyerId()
```
</span>
      </TabPanel>
    </TabPanels>
</Tabs>

## Identify

The `identify` call sets `userId` through the `setCustomerUserId` method of `AppsFlyerLib`.

<div class="infoBlock">

  RudderStack supports the <code class="inline-code">identify</code> calls only in the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">device mode</a>.
</div>

RudderStack sets `email` from the event traits to AppsFlyer using the native SDK's `setUserEmails` method, as shown:

```objectivec
[[RSClient sharedInstance] identify:@"developer_user_id"
                                 traits:@{@"email": @"bar@foo.com"}];
```

## Track

RudderStack's `track` call is mapped to the standard AppsFlyer events wherever possible. 

The following table lists the event mapping from RudderStack to AppsFlyer:

| **RudderStack event**           | **AppsFlyer event**         |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| `Products Searched`         | `af_search`             |
| `Product Viewed`            | `af_content_view`       |
| `Product List Viewed`       | `af_list_view`          |
| `Product Added to Wishlist` | `af_add_to_wishlist`    |
| `Product Added`             | `af_add_to_cart`        |
| `Checkout Started`          | `af_initiated_checkout` |
| `Order Completed`           | `af_purchase`           |
| `Product Removed`           | `remove_from_cart`      |

For any event not present in the above table, RudderStack makes the following changes to the event name before sending it to AppsFlyer via the native SDK:

- Converting the entire event name to lower case
- Replacing any space with an underscore

Along with the above event mapping, RudderStack also maps the event properties to the corresponding AppsFlyer event properties, as shown below:

| RudderStack property name | AppsFlyer property name                                                                                                                                                                |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `query`                   | `af_search_string`                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `price`                   | `af_price`                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `product_id`              | `af_content_id`                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `category`                | `af_content_type`                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `currency`                | `af_currency`                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `products`                | RudderStack formulates this list as per the [**List View specification**](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005544169#event-structure) and passes it to the property `af_content_list`. |
| `quantity`                | `af_quantity`                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `order_id`                | `af_receipt_id`                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `revenue`                 | `af_revenue`                                                                                                                                                                           |

A sample `track` call for an iOS app is shown below:

```objectivec
[[RSClient sharedInstance] track:@"Accepted Terms of Service"
                          properties:@{
                                  @"foo": @"bar",
                              @"foo_int": @134
}];
```

## Screen

For all the `screen` calls sent from the SDK, RudderStack calls AppsFlyer's `trackEvent` method with `screen` as the event name. All the event properties are passed to AppsFlyer without any modification.

For the automatically recorded `screen` calls, RudderStack obtains a Boolean property called `automatic`.

## Advertising ID

RudderStack utilizes the advertising ID for the AppsFlyer destination if it is set as per the following specifications:

- For iOS: [**Advertisement ID documentation**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-ios-sdk/#advertisement-id)

- For Android: [**Advertisement ID documentation**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-android-sdk/#advertisement-id)

You can find the advertising ID in your event's `context.device.advertisementId`.

## ATTrackingManager

If the `ATTrackingManager.trackingAuthorizationStatus` is passed according to [**ATTrackingManager authorization consent**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-ios-sdk/#attrackingmanager-authorization-consent), RudderStack will utilize it for the AppsFlyer destination. 

You can find `trackingAuthorizationStatus` in your event's `context.device.attTrackingStatus`.

## Error messages

This section covers some of the possible error messages you may encounter while using this integration.

### Invalid platform / required androidAppId / appleAppId missing

This error occurs when either the `OS Name` or your respective App ID is not set. 

You can set the **App ID** in your [**settings**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/attribution/appsflyer/#getting-started). 

The SDK automatically sets the `OS Name` and it can be found in `context.os.name`.

### Appsflyer ID is not set. Rejecting the event.

This error occurs when the `appsflyerExternalId` is not set. Refer to the [**Sending events via the RudderStack cloud mode**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/attribution/appsflyer/#sending-events-via-the-rudderstack-cloud-mode) section for more information on setting the `appsflyerExternalId`.

## Debugging

RudderStack sets the `logLevel` in AppsFlyer based on the `logLevel` set for the `RudderClient`. If it is set to `DEBUG` or more, RudderStack sets the `logLevel` to `VERBOSE` for AppsFlyer. 

For anything below that, RudderStack sets the `logLevel` to `NONE` for AppsFlyer.

## FAQs

### Where do I get the AppsFlyer dev key?

You can find the **AppsFlyer Dev Key** by logging into your AppsFlyer account and navigating to the **Apps Settings** page in your dashboard. For more information, refer to this [**AppsFlyer Help Center**](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/211719806-App-settings-) page.

### I get an error saying "Build input file cannot be found" for iOS device mode. What should I do?

The latest AppsFlyer SDK requires XCode 12. Make sure you meet this requirement. You may have to downgrade your AppsFlyer SDK to build with a lower version of XCode. 

You can declare the `pod` version in your `Podfile` as shown:

```ruby
pod 'Rudder-Appsflyer',' 1.0.0'
```

### How do I get the AppsFlyer ID to send events from my mobile sources via the RudderStack cloud mode?

To send events to AppsFlyer via the cloud mode, you first need to obtain the AppsFlyer ID generated by the Appsflyer SDK.

You can get this ID by either directly loading the native AppsFlyer SDK on your app, or loading it via RudderStack (device mode integration).

In case of a device mode integration, include the following code snippet (depending on your platform of integration) in your app to get the AppsFlyer ID:

#import <AppsFlyerLib/AppsFlyerLib.h>
NSString *appsflyerId = [AppsFlyerLib shared].getAppsFlyerUID;
```
</span>
      </TabPanel>
      <TabPanel>
<span>

```java
import com.appsflyer.AppsFlyerLib;
String appsFlyerId = AppsFlyerLib.getInstance().getAppsFlyerUID(this);
```

```javascript
import AppsFlyerIntegrationFactory from "@rudderstack/rudder-integration-appsflyer-react-native/src/bridge"
const appsFlyerId = await AppsFlyerIntegrationFactory.getAppsFlyerId()
```
</span>
      </TabPanel>
    </TabPanels>
</Tabs>

Once you obtain the AppsFlyer ID, you can send events via the cloud mode by by including the `externalId` key within your events' `context`. For more information, refer to the [**Sending events via the RudderStack cloud mode**](#sending-events-via-the-rudderstack-cloud-mode) section above.
