[**AppsFlyer**](https://www.appsflyer.com/) is an industry-leading mobile attribution and marketing analytics platform, provided as a Software-as-a-Service \(SaaS\). It offers intuitive dashboards, real-time data reports, and a unique deep linking technology to understand your customers better. 

RudderStack supports AppsFlyer as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your customer data.

<div class="successBlock">

  Find the open-source transformer code for this destination in our <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/v0/destinations/af">GitHub repository</a>.
</div>

## Getting started

Before configuring AppsFlyer as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by AppsFlyer by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | -             | **Supported** | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between the cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, read the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack connection modes</a> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the platform supports sending events to AppsFlyer, perform the steps below:

- From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **AppsFlyer**.

<div class="infoBlock">

Follow our guide on <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/">Adding a Source and Destination in RudderStack</a> for more information.
</div>

- Assign a name to the destination and click on **Next**. You should then see the following screen:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/appsflyer-connection-settings-final.png" alt="AppsFlyer connection settings in RudderStack" />

### Connection settings

The connection settings required to configure AppsFlyer as a destination in RudderStack are listed below:

- Enter the **AppsFlyer Dev Key**.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on where to find the AppsFlyer dev key, refer to the <a href="#faqs">FAQs</a> section below.
</div>

- **Sharing Filter**: By default, the value for this setting is set to `all`. 

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on this field can be found in the <a href="https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/207034486-Server-to-server-events-API-for-mobile-S2S-mobile-#sharing_filter-16">AppsFlyer documentation</a>.
</div>

- **App ID**: RudderStack supports all the sources for the AppsFlyer destination. If your source is other than **Android** or the **Apple** sources (iOS, watchOS, iPadOS, tvOS) then a user transformation in the dashboard is needed to manipulate the `os` name.
  - **Android App ID**: This the application ID used in your `app/build.gradle` file.
  - **Apple App ID**: This is the iTunes Application ID and it is mandatory for the iOS applications.

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack supports all the other sources for the AppsFlyer destination, in addition to the Android and iOS sources. Refer to the <a href="#connecting-appsflyer-to-non-androidios-sources">Connecting AppsFlyer to non-Android/iOS sources</a> section below for more information.
</div>

- **Use native SDK to send events**: By default, this setting will be enabled. To send events via the cloud mode or device mode, you can toggle this setting on or off.

- Finally, click on **Next** to complete the configuration. AppsFlyer should now be added and enabled as a destination in RudderStack.

## Connecting AppsFlyer to non-Android/iOS sources

As mentioned above, the AppsFlyer destination supports all the RudderStack sources in addition to Android and iOS. However, you will need to add a transformation to the destination by following these steps:

- Go to your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/).

- Add a new transformation by following the instructions listed in [**this guide**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/transformation/#adding-a-transformation). Use the following transformation function:

```javascript
export function transformEvent(event, metadata) {
  event.context.os = {
    name: "android"
  };
  return event;
}
```

- Save the transformation.

- Finally, configure your AppsFlyer destination and select this transformation in the **Choose an existing transformation** window, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/appsflyer-2.png" alt="AppsFlyer transformation settings in RudderStack" />

- If you have already configured your AppsFlyer destination, navigate to the **Transformation** option, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/appsflyer-3.png" alt="Transformation settings after adding destination" />

- Click on **Add a transformation** and select the transformation you created above.

## Sending events via the RudderStack cloud mode

For all cloud mode calls, the `externalId` key must be present and must include the AppsFlyer ID, as well as the type of `appsFlyerExternalId`, as shown:

```javascript
"externalId": [
  {
    "id": "some_other2345_sample_external_id",
    "type": "appsflyerExternalId"
  }
]
```

<div class="infoBlock">

  RudderStack expects the <code class="inline-code">externalId</code> to be present under the event's <code class="inline-code">context</code>.
</div>

<div class="successBlock">

For more information on how to get the AppsFlyer ID, refer to this <a href="https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/207034486-Server-to-server-events-API-for-mobile-S2S-mobile-#fetching-the-appsflyer-id">AppsFlyer documentation</a>.
</div>


## Identify

The `identify` call sets `userId` through `AppsFlyerLib`'s `setCustomerUserId` method.

<div class="infoBlock">

  RudderStack supports the <code class="inline-code">identify</code> calls only in the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">device mode</a>.
</div>

RudderStack sets `email` from event traits to AppsFlyer using the native SDK's `setUserEmails` method, as shown:

```objectivec
[[RSClient sharedInstance] identify:@"developer_user_id"
                                 traits:@{@"email": @"bar@foo.com"}];
```

## Track

RudderStack's `track` call is mapped to the standard AppsFlyer events wherever possible.

The event mapping is shown in the following table:

| **RudderStack Event**           | **AppsFlyer Event**         |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| `Products Searched`         | `af_search`             |
| `Product Viewed`            | `af_content_view`       |
| `Product List Viewed`       | `af_list_view`          |
| `Product Added to Wishlist` | `af_add_to_wishlist`    |
| `Product Added`             | `af_add_to_cart`        |
| `Checkout Started`          | `af_initiated_checkout` |
| `Order Completed`           | `af_purchase`           |
| `Product Removed`           | `remove_from_cart`      |

For any event not present in the above table, RudderStack makes the following changes to the event name before sending it to AppsFlyer via the native SDK:

- Converts the entire event name to lower case.
- Replaces any space with an underscore.

Along with the above event mapping, RudderStack also maps the event properties to the corresponding AppsFlyer event properties, as shown below:

| RudderStack Property Name | AppsFlyer Property Name                                                                                                                                                                |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `query`                   | `af_search_string`                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `price`                   | `af_price`                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `product_id`              | `af_content_id`                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `category`                | `af_content_type`                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `currency`                | `af_currency`                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `products`                | RudderStack formulates this list as per List View [**specification**](https://support.appsflyer.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005544169#event-structure) and passes it to the property `af_content_list`. |
| `quantity`                | `af_quantity`                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `order_id`                | `af_receipt_id`                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `revenue`                 | `af_revenue`                                                                                                                                                                           |

A sample `track` call for an iOS application is shown below:

```objectivec
[[RSClient sharedInstance] track:@"Accepted Terms of Service"
                          properties:@{
                                  @"foo": @"bar",
                              @"foo_int": @134
}];
```

## Screen

For all the `screen` calls from the SDK, RudderStack calls the AppsFlyer `trackEvent` method with the event name as `screen`. All the event properties are passed to AppsFlyer as is.

RudderStack performs the same task for the automatically recorded `screen` calls as well. For those calls, a Boolean property called `automatic` is obtained in the properties.

## Mobile SDK ID for advertisers

#### Advertising ID

If the advertising ID is set according to the associated docs, RudderStack will utilize them appropriately for the AppsFlyer destination. They should be found in `context.device.advertisementId`:

- For iOS: [**Advertisement ID documentation**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-ios-sdk/#advertisement-id)
- For Android: [**Advertisement ID documentation**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-android-sdk/#advertisement-id)

#### ATTrackingManager

If the `ATTrackingManager.trackingAuthorizationStatus` is passed according to [**this documentation**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-ios-sdk/#attrackingmanager-authorization-consent), RudderStack will utilize it for the AppsFlyer destination. It should be found in `context.device.attTrackingStatus`.

## Error messages

This section covers some of the possible error messages you may encounter while using this integration:

### Invalid platform or required androidAppId or appleAppId missing.

This error occurs when either the `OS Name` is not set or your respective App ID is not set. You can set the **App ID** in your settings \(see the [**Getting started**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/attribution/appsflyer/#getting-started) section above\). The `OS Name` should be set by the SDK automatically and it should be present at `context.os.name`.

### Appsflyer ID is not set. Rejecting the event.

This error occurs when the `appsflyerExternalId` is not set. Refer to the [**Sending events via the RudderStack cloud mode**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/attribution/appsflyer/#sending-events-via-the-rudderstack-cloud-mode) section above to see how to properly set the `appsflyerExternalId`.

## Debugging

RudderStack sets the `logLevel` in AppsFlyer based on the `logLevel` set for the `RudderClient`. If it is set for `DEBUG` or more, RudderStack sets the `logLevel` to `VERBOSE` for AppsFlyer. For anything below that, RudderStack sets the `logLevel` to `NONE` for AppsFlyer.

## FAQs

### Where do I get the AppsFlyer developer key?

You can find the **AppsFlyer Dev Key** by logging into your AppsFlyer account and navigating to the **Apps Settings** page in your dashboard.

### I get an error saying "Build input file cannot be found" for iOS device mode?

The latest AppsFlyer SDK requires XCode 12. Make sure you meet this requirement. You may have to downgrade your AppsFlyer SDK to build with a lower version of XCode. You can declare the version with the `pod` in your `Podfile` as shown:

```ruby
pod 'Rudder-Appsflyer',' 1.0.0'
```

### How do I get the AppsFlyer ID to send events from my mobile sources via the RudderStack cloud mode?

Depending on your platform of integration, include the following code snippet to get the `AppsFlyerId`:
