# Airship

[Airship](https://www.airship.com/) is an app experience platform that lets you create and deliver powerful in-app experiences with the help of engaging, personalized content and actionable customer insights.

RudderStack supports Airship as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your event data.

## Getting started

Before configuring Airship as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**         | **Mobile**   | **Server**        |
| :-------------------| :-------------- | :----------- | :-----------------|
| **Device mode**     | -               | -            | -                 |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported**               | **Supported**           |  **Supported**    |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</a> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Airship, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Airship**.

<div class="infoBlock">

Follow our guide on <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/">Adding a Source and Destination in RudderStack</a> for more information.
</div>

2. Assign a name to your destination and click on **Next**.

### Connection settings

To successfully configure Airship as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/airship-connection-settings.png" alt="Airship connection settings" />

- **API Key**: Enter your Airship token required by RudderStack to communicate with your Airship project.

<div class="infoBlock">

For detailed steps on obtaining the API key, refer to the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section below.
</div>

- **App Key**: Enter your Airship project's app key by going to **Settings** > **Project Details**.
- **App Secret**: Enter your Airship project's app secret by going to **Settings** > **Project Details**.

<div class="infoBlock">

For detailed steps on obtaining the Airship app key and secret, refer to the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section below.
</div>

- **EU data center**: Enable this setting if you've implemented your app in Airship's European data center.

<div class="infoBlock">

If you're unsure which data center you are on, reach out to <a href="mailto:%20docs@rudderstack.com" target="_blank">Airship support</a>
</div>

## Identify

The `identify` call lets you uniquely identify a user and record any associated traits about them like their name, email, etc.

<div class="infoBlock">

For information on the <code class="inline-code">identify</code> call, refer to the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/identify/">RudderStack API Specification</a> guide.
</div>

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm", {
  "likes_movies": true,
  "favorite_color": "purple",
  "age": 13
});
```

In the above code snippet, RudderStack sends the Boolean values to Airship as [tags](https://docs.airship.com/api/ua/#operation-api-named_users-tags-post), whereas the non-Boolean values are sent as [attributes](https://docs.airship.com/api/ua/#operation-api-named_users-named_user_id-attributes-post).

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack maps some reserved traits to the predefined Airship attributes. Refer to the <a href="#traits-mapping">Traits mapping</a> section below for more information.
</div>

### Tags

To successfully assign tags to Airship using the RudderStack `identify` events, you must create a tag group with the group key set to `rudderstack_integration` in Airship. 

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on creating a tag group in Airship, refer to the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section below.
</div>

This integration supports `identify` traits of type Boolean only. Airship adds tags for the traits that are set to `true` and removes tags for the traits set to `false`.

### Attributes

For `identify` traits that are not mapped to any predefined or custom-defined Airship attributes, you must create and enable those attributes in the Airship dashboard. 

<div class="infoBlock">

Refer to the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section below for more information on creating and enabling attributes in Airship.
</div>

## Track

The [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/track/) call lets you record the user's actions along with any associated properties. Each user action is called an event.

RudderStack sends the `track` events to Airship via their [Custom Events API](https://docs.airship.com/api/ua/#operation-api-custom-events-post). You can use the event properties to personalize and trigger specific messages for your audience.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Product Clicked", {
  description: "Shoes viewed",
  brand: "Sneakers",
  colors: ["red", "blue"],
  items: [{
      text: "New Balance Sneakers",
      price: "$69.95",
    },
    {
      text: "G.I. Joe Sneakers",
      price: "$99.95",
    },
  ],
});
```

The event name sent to Airship must not contain any upper case characters. Otherwise, it is rejected with a `400` status code. RudderStack handles this by converting any upper case characters to lower case and replacing any spaces with an underscore(`_`). 

In the snippet above, the event name `Product Clicked` is automatically converted to `product_clicked` before sending to Airship.

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack also maps some event properties to the Airship properties before sending them over to Airship. For more information, refer to the <a href="#supported-mapping">Supported mappings</a> section below.
</div>

## Group

The [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/group/) call lets you link an identified user with a group such as a company, organization, or an account, and record any traits associated with that group, e.g., company name, number of employees, etc.

A sample `group` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.group(
  {
  "userId": "1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm"
  "likes_movies": true,
  age: 13,
  }
);
```

In the above code snippet, RudderStack sends the Boolean values to Airship as [tags](https://docs.airship.com/api/ua/#operation-api-named_users-tags-post), whereas the non-Boolean values are sent as [attributes](https://docs.airship.com/api/ua/#operation-api-named_users-named_user_id-attributes-post).

This integration supports `group` traits of type Boolean only. Airship adds tags for the traits that are set to `true` and removes tags for the traits set to `false`.

<div class="warningBlock">

To successfully assign tags to Airship using the RudderStack <code class="inline-code">group</code> events, you must create a tag group with the group key set to <code class="inline-code">rudderstack_integration_group</code> in Airship. Similarly, you need to create the relevant attribute identifiers in Airship to set the attributes on the named users.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on creating a tag group or attributes in Airship, refer to the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section below.
</div>
