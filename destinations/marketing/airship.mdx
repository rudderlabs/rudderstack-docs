# Airship

[Airship](https://www.airship.com/) is an app experience platform that lets you create and deliver powerful in-app experiences with the help of engaging, personalized content and actionable customer insights.

RudderStack supports Airship as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your event data.

## Getting started

Before configuring Airship as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**         | **Mobile**   | **Server**        |
| :-------------------| :-------------- | :----------- | :-----------------|
| **Device mode**     | -               | -            | -                 |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported**               | **Supported**           |  **Supported**    |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</a> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Airship, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Airship**.

</div>

2. Assign a name to your destination and click on **Next**.

## Identify

The `identify` call lets you uniquely identify a user and record any associated traits about them like their name, email, etc.

<div class="infoBlock">

For information on the <code class="inline-code">identify</code> call, refer to the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/identify/">RudderStack API Specification</a> guide.
</div>

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript

```

Airship assigns tags to the [named users](https://docs.airship.com/guides/messaging/user-guide/audience/segmentation/named-users/) based on the incoming RudderStack `identify` calls. 

<div class="warningBlock">

To successfully assign tags to Airship using the RudderStack <code class="inline-code">identify</code> events, you must create a tag group with the group key set to <code class="inline-code">rudderstack-integration</code> in Airship. For more information on creating a tag group in Airship, refer to the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section below.
</div>

### Attribute mapping

RudderStack maps the following reserved traits to the predefined Airship attributes:

| RudderStack trait | Airship attribute |
| :-----------------| :-----------------|
| `address.city` | `city` |
| `address.country` | `country` |
| `address.postalcode` | `zipcode` |
| `address.state` | `region` |
| `createdAt` | `account_creation` |
| `firstName` | `first_name` |
| `lastName` | `last_name` |
| `name` | `full_name` |
| `phone` | `mobile_phone` |

## Track

The `track` call lets you record the user's actions along with any associated properties. Each user action is called an event. 

<div class="infoBlock">

For information on the <code class="inline-code">track</code> call, refer to the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/track/">RudderStack API Specification</a> guide.
</div>

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript

```

RudderStack sends the `track` events to Airship via their [Custom Events API](https://docs.airship.com/api/ua/#operation-api-custom-events-post). You can use the event properties to personalize and trigger specific messages for your audience.

### Supported mappings

RudderStack maps the following event properties to the Airship properties before sending them over to Airship.
