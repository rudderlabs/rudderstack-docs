# Blueshift

[Blueshift](https://blueshift.com/) is a powerful eCommerce platform that lets you boost your business revenue. It supports unique features such as category-based segmentation and various event triggers based on page views, purchases, email engagement, etc. You can easily track and measure all your user activity and the resulting revenue and get a breakdown of this revenue based on different custom attributes.

Blueshift also offers features such as trend reports, cohort analysis, and various options for boosting customer engagement, such as personalized newsletters, product recommendations, in-app push notifications, and more.

RudderStack supports Blueshift as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your event data.

Find the open-source transformer code for this destination in our <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/v0/destinations/blueshift">GitHub repo</a>.
</div>

## Getting started

Before configuring Blueshift as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Blueshift by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     |               |               |               |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</a> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Blueshift, follow these steps:

- From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Blueshift**.

<div class="infoBlock">

Follow our guide on <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/">Adding a Source and Destination in RudderStack</a> for more information.
</div>

## Connection settings

To successfully configure Blueshift as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/klaviyo-connection-settings.png" alt="Blueshift connection settings"/>

- **Event API Key**: Your Public API Key is the unique key generated against your Klaviyo account. It can be found in your Klaviyo dashboard in the **Account** section under **Settings**.

- **Users API Key**: Your Private API key can be generated for your account in the **Account** section under **Settings**. This key allows you to add users to a list or subscribe them using personalised emails/SMS.

- **Blueshift EU data center**: If this option is enabled, RudderStack will never set `$id` field to your `userId` when you send the events. Instead, RudderStack will only set a custom attribute `_id` and `$email` as the primary identifier with your `traits.email` or `properties.email`. 

<div class="infoBlock">

In case <code class="inline-code">userId</code> is absent, RudderStack uses <code class="inline-code">anonymousId</code> for mapping the user with an unique identifier. In case both <code class="inline-code">userId</code> and <code class="inline-code">anonymousId</code> are absent, then <code class="inline-code">email</code> or <code class="inline-code">phone</code> will be considered as the user's primary identifier.
</div>

## Identify

The `identify` call lets you identify a visiting user and associate them to their actions. It also lets you record the traits about them like their name, email address, etc.

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("userid", {
  firstName: "Name",
  lastName: "Surname",
  email: "name@website.com",
  phone: "+12 345 678 900",
  userId: "userId",
  title: "Owner",
  organization: "Company",
  city: "Tokyo",
  region: "ABC",
  country: "JP",
  zip: "100-0001",
  Flagged: false,
  Residence: "Shibuya",
  properties: {
    listId: "XUepkK",
    subscribe: true,
    consent: "email",
    smsConsent: true,
  },
})
```

In the above snippet, RudderStack captures the user-related information like the `email`, `phone`, as well as the associated traits of the user.

<div class="infoBlock">

To map a user in Klaviyo, you need either the <code class="inline-code">userId</code>, <code class="inline-code">email</code>, or <code class="inline-code">phone</code>. If a user already exists, the new values will be updated for that user. 
</div>



## Track

The `track` call allows you to capture user actions along with the properties associated with these actions. 

<div class="infoBlock">

Each user action is called as an <strong>event</strong>. 
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

The user has to be associated with an event either via their <code class="inline-code">userId</code>, <code class="inline-code">email</code>, or <code class="inline-code">phone</code>.
</div>

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Checked Out", {
  Clicked_Rush_delivery_Button: true,
  total_value: 2000,
  Ordered: ["T-Shirt", "jacket"],
  revenue: 2000,
})
```

In the above snippet, RudderStack captures the information related to the `Checked Out` event, along with the details of the event.

A sample server-side `track` call along with the user information is as shown:

```javascript
client.track({
  userId: "user2",
  event: "Item Purchased",
  properties: {
    revenue: 97.5,
    products: [
      {
        productId: "pro1",
        price: 32.5,
        quantity: 3,
      },
    ],
  },
  context: {
    traits: {
      email: "user2@gmail.com",
    },
  },
})
```

In the above snippet, RudderStack captures the information related to the `Item Purchased` event, along with any additional info about that event in `properties` - in this case the `revenue`, along with product information. Moreover since this event is captured using a server-side SDK, RudderStack passes the user information in `context`, along with a unique `userId`.

<div class="infoBlock">

<ul>
<li>To send <code class="inline-code">track</code> or <code class="inline-code">screen</code> type event using an SDK that does not persist user context information after <code class="inline-code">identify</code>, you need to pass the information in <code class="inline-code">context.traits</code>.</li>

<li>To set a specific value to the <code class="inline-code">screen</code> or <code class="inline-code">track</code> type event, you need to pass the event-related property in the <code class="inline-code">properties</code> field. Also, you can send <code class="inline-code">revenue</code> property in the <code class="inline-code">track</code> event and RudderStack will automatically map it to Klaviyo's special property <code class="inline-code">$value</code>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Group

<div class="infoBlock">

Adding or subscribing users to a specific list via the <code class="inline-code">group</code> event is only available in cloud mode integration. To know more about the RudderStack cloud mode, read the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack connection modes</a> guide.
</div>

The `group` call lets you link an identified user with a group, such as a company, organization, or an account. It also lets you record any custom traits associated with that group, such as the name of the company, the number of employees, etc.

A sample server-side `group` call looks like the following:

```javascript
client.group({
  userId: "userId",
  groupId: "listId",
  traits: {
    subscribe: true,
  },
  context: {
    traits: {
      email: "user.test@gmail.com",
      city: "city",
      country: "country",
      zip: "213456",
      age: 23,
      plan: "free",
      consent: "email",
      phone: "1-617-555-1333",
      smsConsent: true,
    },
  },
})
```

In the above snippet, the user with the associated traits is added to list, and also subscribed using the `subscribe` flag.

<div class="infoBlock">

Apart from <code class="inline-code">userId</code>, <code class="inline-code">email</code>, or <code class="inline-code">phone</code>, the other fields are not mandatory.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

Adding <code class="inline-code">consent</code> and <code class="inline-code">smsConsent</code> property in the user traits will override the settings specified in the RudderStack dashboard for the specific event.
</div>

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("checkout started ", {
  order_id: "1234",
  value: 12.34,
  categories: ["category1", "category2"],
  checkout_url: "http://www.testcall.com",
  item_names: ["item1", "item2"],
  items: [{

      row_total: 2.0
    },
  ],
});
```

<div class="warningBlock">

When sending events via the web device mode, specifying <code class="inline-code">order_id</code> is not mandatory, as Klaviyo automatically assigns the timestamp to the event. However, if explicitly specified, it <strong>must be unique</strong>. Klaviyo automatically discards the events with a duplicate <code class="inline-code">order_id</code>.
