# Iterable

[Iterable](https://iterable.com/) is a popular growth marketing platform that lets you maximize customer interaction and improve your customers' overall LTV \(Life Time Value\).

RudderStack supports Iterable as a destination where you send your event data seamlessly.

## Getting started

First, verify if the source platform is supported by Iterable by referring to the following table:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | **-**         | -             | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</a> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the platform supports sending events to Iterable, follow these steps:

- From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Iterable**.

<div class="infoBlock">

Refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/">Adding a Source and Destination in RudderStack</a> guide for more information.
</div>

- Assign a name to the destination and click on **Next**.

### Connection settings

To successfully configure Iterable as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/iterable-connection-settings.png" alt="Iterable connection settings" />

- **Iterable API Key**: Enter your Iterable API key. You can obtain it by going to the **API Configuration Settings** section in your Iterable account.
- **Map All Pages to Single Event Name**: If this setting is enabled, all the pages will be tracked to Iterable with the same event name.
  - For `page` events, RudderStack will set the event name as `Loaded a Page`.
  - For `screen` events, RudderStack will set the event name as `Loaded a Screen`.
- **Track All Pages**: If this setting is enabled, all the page events will be sent to Iterable.
- **Track Categorized Pages**: If this setting is enabled, only pages with a category present will be tracked.
- **Track Named Pages**: If this setting is enabled, RudderStack will track only the pages having a name.

## Identify

When you make an `identify` call, RudderStack calls Iterable's [Update User](https://api.iterable.com/api/docs#users_updateUser) API and sends the data accordingly.

<div class="warningBlock">

Iterable identifies a user by <code class="inline-code">email</code> or <code class="inline-code">userId</code>. If none of these traits is present in the call, RudderStack will not send the event to Iterable.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

Iterable gives precedence to <code class="inline-code">email</code> over <code class="inline-code">userId</code> in case both the traits are present in the <code class="inline-code">identify</code> call.
</div>

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify(
  "userId",
  {
    city: "California",
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "sample@website.com",
    country: "USA"
  }
);
```

If the `deviceToken` for Push Notification is present in `context` of the payload then a mapping will be done for the user with the device to register for push. This will add the data if it doesn't exist yet. It will also update data fields on the device.

We use [mobile device registration](https://api.iterable.com/api/docs#users_registerDeviceToken) API for sending the token information from a device. We set the `platform` parameter as `APNS` and `GCM` for iOS and Android devices respectively. Similarly, we use the [browser token registration](https://api.iterable.com/api/docs#users_registerBrowserToken) API for Web platform.

<div class="infoBlock">

To understand more about Push Notification registration check the Iterable guides for <a href="https://support.iterable.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000331943#_2-create-a-mobile-app-in-iterable">Android</a> and <a href="https://support.iterable.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000315806#_4-create-a-mobile-app-in-iterable">iOS</a>.

</div>

## Page

When the `page` method is called, the RudderStack server sends a track event to Iterable with the `userId`, `emailId`, and `eventName` parameters.

If the user does not already exist in Iterable, RudderStack will add the user to the system as long as `email` is present in the call. If email is not present, Iterable will reject the event.

<div class="infoBlock">

Iterable requires that you pass <code class="inline-code">email</code> the first time you call <code class="inline-code">page</code> for a user. Subsequent calls can use the <code class="inline-code">userId</code> identifier.

</div>

If the name of the page is **Application Home** the event name in iterable will be **Application Home Page.**

<div class="infoBlock">

Note that the above case will differ according to the settings set by the user in RudderStack dashboard. Refer to the configurable settings in the Getting Started section above for more information.

</div>

A sample `page` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page({
  path: "path",
  url: "url",
  title: "title",
  search: "search",
  referrer: "referrer",
})
```

## Screen

The `screen` call is the mobile equivalent of the `page`. When called, it sends a `track` event to Iterable with `userId`,`emailId`, and `eventName` . In this case, the email ID will be checked if present and will create a new user if not. If the name of the page is **Main Activity**, the event name will set as **Main Activity Screen**.

<div class="infoBlock">

Note that the above case will differ according to the settings set by the user in RudderStack dashboard. Refer to the configurable settings in the Getting Started section above for more information.

</div>

A sample `screen` call is as shown:

```objectivec
[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@"Main"];
```

## Track

When the `track` call is made, the [track API endpoint](https://api.iterable.com/api/docs#!/events/track_post_0) of Iterable is called by RudderStack to send the events. The event properties are sent as data fields in the request, while the name of the event is sent as a Custom Event.

A sample`track` call is as shown:

```objectivec
[[RSClient sharedInstance] track:@"Accepted Terms of Service"
                          properties:@{
                                  @"foo": @"bar",
                              @"foo_int": @134
}];
```

<div class="infoBlock">

If a user does not exist in Iterable, the <code class="inline-code">track</code> call for the user event will add the user in Iterable.

</div>

## E-Commerce

You can find the relevant details of the eCommerce events in the [RudderStack E-Commerce Events Specification](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-ecommerce-events-specification/) guide.

### Order Completed

The E-Commerce event `Order Completed` is supported by RudderStack. The other events will be sent as simple track events. The end point details of Iterable is in the [Track a purchase](https://api.iterable.com/api/docs#commerce_trackPurchase) event.

User properties, item properties and total are compulsory for sending the order completed event.

Below is an example `Order Completed` event.

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Order Completed", {
  total: 1000,
  products: [
    {
      product_id: "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
      sku: "45790-32",
      name: "Monopoly: 3rd Edition",
      price: "19",
      position: "1",
      category: "Cars",
      url: "https://www.example.com/product/path",
      image_url: "https://www.example.com/product/path.jpg",
    },
    {
      product_id: "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
      sku: "45790-32",
      name: "Monopoly: 3rd Edition",
      price: "19",
      quantity: "2",
      position: "1",
      category: "Cars",
      url: "https://www.example.com/product/path",
      image_url: "https://www.example.com/product/path.jpg",
    },
  ],
})
```

### Product Added/Removed

The eCommerce event `Product Added` or `Product Removed` is supported by RudderStack. It is sent to Iterable with the end point details present in the [Update a user's shopping cart items](https://api.iterable.com/api/docs#commerce_updateCart) event.

For this event, the user has to send the whole updated cart and not the individual items that are being added or removed.

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Product Added", {
  total: 1000,
  products: [
    {
      product_id: "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
      sku: "45790-32",
      name: "Monopoly: 3rd Edition",
      price: "19",
      position: "1",
      category: "Cars",
      url: "https://www.example.com/product/path",
      image_url: "https://www.example.com/product/path.jpg",
    },
    {
      product_id: "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
      sku: "45790-32",
      name: "Monopoly: 3rd Edition",
      price: "19",
      quantity: "2",
      position: "1",
      category: "Cars",
      url: "https://www.example.com/product/path",
      image_url: "https://www.example.com/product/path.jpg",
    },
  ],
})
```

<div class="infoBlock">

For this event, the user properties and item properties are compulsory.

</div>
