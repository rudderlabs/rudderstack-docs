## Getting Started

Before configuring your source and destination on the RudderStack, please check whether the platform you are sending the events from is supported by Appcues. Please refer the following table to do so:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | **Supported** | -             | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">

If you would like to use the entire functionality of Appcues like displaying flows, checklists, and surveys, please use Appcues **device mode** and not **cloud mode**.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">
To know more about the difference between Cloud mode and Device mode in RudderStack, read the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack connection modes</a> guide.

</div>

Once you have confirmed that the platform supports sending events to Appcues, perform the steps below:

- From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source and select **Appcues** from the list of destinations.

<div class="infoBlock">
Please follow our guide on <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/">How to Add a Source and Destination in RudderStack</a> to add a source and destination in RudderStack.

</div>

- Name your destination, and click on **Next**. You should be able to see the following screen:

<div class="infoBlock">

You need to make an `identify` call before making any call to Appcues.
</div>

## Identify

The `identify` call is used to uniquely identify a user in Appcues. For more information on the `identify` call, please refer to the [RudderStack API Specification](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api-spec) documentation.

A sample `identify` call looks like the following snippet:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("userId", {
  name: "John Doe",
  title: "CEO",
  email: "name.surname@domain.com",
  company: "Company123",
  phone: "123-456-7890",
  state: "Texas",
  rating: "Hot",
  city: "Austin",
  postalCode: "12345",
  country: "US",
  street: "Sample Address",
  state: "TX",
})
```

The above call is directly passed on to Appcues via its `Appcues.identify(userId,[properties])` call.

## Track

A `track` call lets you track custom events as they occur in your web application. For more information on the `track` call, please refer to the [RudderStack API Specification](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api-spec) documentation.

A sample `track` call looks like the following:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Clicked button", {
  color: "red",
  buttonText: "Get started",
})
```

<div class="infoBlock">

The above call is directly passed on to Appcues via its `Appcues.track(eventName, [eventProperties])` call.

</div>

## Page

A `page` call contains information such as the URL or the name of the web page visited by the user. For more information on the `page` call, please refer to the [RudderStack API Specification](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api-spec) documentation.

A sample `page` call looks like the following:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page("homepage")
```

<div class="infoBlock">

In device mode, the `page` call is directly passed on to Appcues via its `Appcues.page()` call, along with any additional properties passed to it. Appcues will check to see if a user qualifies for an experience every time the page changes. When you first make the `page` call via RudderStack’s `rudderanalytics` object, Appcues checks if there are any current flows associated with the given user and loads them, if necessary.

</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

In the cloud mode, the above `page` call is sent as a `track` event with the name as `Visited a Page`, along with any additional properties passed to it. It also updates the properties associated with the user profile such as `User ID`, `Last Browser Language`, `Updated At`, `User Agent`, `Current Page URL`, `Current Page Title` .

</div>

## Screen

<div class="infoBlock">

The `screen` call is available only in the RudderStack Cloud mode.

</div>

The `screen` method allows you to record whenever a user sees the mobile screen, along with any associated optional properties.

A sample `screen` call looks like the following code snippet:

```javascript
[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@"Main" properties:@{@"prop_key" : @"prop_value"}];
```

In the above snippet, we capture information related to the screen being viewed, such as screen's name and category.

<div class="infoBlock">

The above call is sent as a `track` event with the name `Viewed a Screen`, along with any additional properties passed to it.

</div>
