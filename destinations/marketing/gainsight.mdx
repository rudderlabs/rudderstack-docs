</div>

## Identify

RudderStack creates a `Person` object in Gainsight for the `identify` call. Gainsight uses the `Email` field as an identifier and it is mandatory to merge the object. Hence, for an `identify` call, the `email` field is mandatory.

For the default fields in Gainsight `Person` object, the camelCase notation is used in the RudderStack payload traits.

The mapping of the RudderStack traits to the Gainsight `Person` object fields is as shown:

| **Gainsight Person Field** | **RudderStack Trait Name** |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| `Email`                    | `email`                    |
| `Name`                     | `name`                     |
| `FirstName`                | `firstName`                |
| `MiddleName`               | `middleName`               |
| `LastName`                 | `lastName`                 |
| `LinkedinUrl`              | `linkedinUrl`              |
| `Location`                 | `location`                 |
| `ExternalRecordID__gc`     | `externalRecordId`         |
| `EmailOptOut`              | `emailOptOut`              |
| `DynamicResolutionKey`     | `dynamicResolutionKey`     |
| `Comments`                 | `comments`                 |
| `Timezone`                 | `timezone`                 |
| `MasterRecordID`           | `masterRecordId`           |
| `MasterAvatarTypeCode`     | `masterAvatarTypeCode`     |

An example of the `identify` call in RudderStack is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify(
  "sample-user-id",
  {
    email: "user@email.com",
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    comments: "example identify call",
  },
  () => console.log("identify callback")
)
```

<div class="infoBlock">
Custom fields are supported for <code class="inline-code">identify</code>. Refer to the section below for details.

</div>

### Custom Fields

You can create custom fields in the Gainsight schema for a `Person` object as shown in the image below:

<img src="../../assets/gainsightcs-custom-field-person.png" /><span class="imageTitle">gainsightcs-custom-field-person</span>

Then, you can add the RudderStack trait name for the Gainsight custom field mapping in the RudderStack dashboard as shown:

<img src="../../assets/gainsightcs-person-map.png" /><span class="imageTitle">gainsightcs-field-map-person</span>

<div class="infoBlock">
When you add custom fields in the Gainsight schema, <code class="inline-code">__gc</code> is automatically suffixed at the end. Therefore, you need to provide the field name including the <code class="inline-code">__gc</code> suffix in the RudderStack dashboard as shown above.

</div>

## Group

The `group` call associates a person with a group. RudderStack's `group` call creates a `Company` object if it is not present or updated with the provided traits. The `Name` field in is used as the unique identifier.

<div class="infoBlock">
For making a <code class="inline-code">group</code> call, <code class="inline-code">email</code> is a mandatory field in <code class="inline-code">context.traits</code> of the RudderStack event payload.

</div>

The mapping of the RudderStack traits to the Gainsight `Company` object fields is as shown:

| **Gainsight Company Field** | **RudderStack Trait Name** |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------- |
| `Name`                      | `name`                     |
| `Employees`                 | `employees`                |
| `Arr`                       | `arr`                      |
| `BillingAddress`            | `billingAddress`           |
| `Summary`                   | `summary`                  |
| `Csm`                       | `csm`                      |
| `CustomerlifetimeInMonths`  | `customerLifetimeInMonths` |
| `Industry`                  | `industry`                 |
| `LifecycleInWeeks`          | `lifecycleInWeeks`         |
| `ManagedAs`                 | `managedAs`                |
| `Mrr`                       | `mrr`                      |
| `OriginalContractDate`      | `originalContractDate`     |
| `ParentCompany`             | `parentCompany`            |
| `RenewalDate`               | `renewalDate`              |
| `Stage`                     | `stage`                    |
| `Status`                    | `status`                   |
| `Tags`                      | `tags`                     |
| `TickerSymbol`              | `tickerSymbol`             |
| `Users`                     | `users`                    |
| `SfdcAccountId`             | `sfdcAccountId`            |
| `IndustryNew`               | `industryNew`              |

An example `group` call is as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.group(
  "sample-group-id",
  {
    name: "Example Company",
    employees: 1000,
    industry: "Software",
  },
  () => console.log("group callback")
)
```

<div class="infoBlock">
Custom Fields are supported for the <code class="inline-code">group</code> call. For details, refer to the section below.

</div>

### Custom Fields

To send custom properties to Gainsight CS via RudderStack, you first need to create custom fields in the Gainsight schema for the `Company` object, as shown in the following image:

<img src="../../assets/gainsightcs-custom-field-company.png" /><span class="imageTitle">gainsightcs-custom-field-company</span>

Then, you can add the RudderStack trait name for the Gainsight custom field mapping in the RudderStack dashboard:

<img src="../../assets/gainsightcs-company-map.png" /><span class="imageTitle">gainsightcs-field-map-company</span>

<div class="infoBlock">
When you add custom fields in the Gainsight schema, <code class="inline-code">__gc</code> is automatically suffixed at the end. Therefore, you need to provide the field name including the <code class="inline-code">__gc</code> suffix in the RudderStack dashboard as shown above.

</div>

## Track

The `track` call is used to work with the Gainsight Events Framework. The Gainsight Events Framework lets you create events which can then be used in the **Programs** and **Rules Engine**.

Gainsight events are identified with `Event Name` and `Event Version`. The events are grouped under `Topics`. Note that there can be multiple events under a topic.

To start sending events, you will first need to register as a Publisher in Gainsight by going to **Administration** - **Events** and clicking on **Register as Publisher**. This generates a unique shared secret required for working with Gainsight Events Framework.

<div class="infoBlock">

More information on the Gainsight Events Framework can be found in their <a href="https://support.gainsight.com/Gainsight_NXT/Journey_Orchestrator_and_Email_Templates/Programs/Events_Framework#Event_API_Contract">support page</a>.

</div>

Provide the required event settings in the RudderStack dashboard as shown:

<img src="../../assets/gainsightcs-event-main-settings.png" /><span class="imageTitle">gainsight-event-main-settings</span>

The required settings are:

- **Shared Secret**: This is a required field. Go to **Administration** - **Events** and click on **Register as Publisher** to get this key.
- **TenantId**: The Tenant ID of the Publisher is a required field. You can copy this ID by going to **Administration** - **Application Settings**.
- **Contract ID**: This field is optional. If a user subscribes to a contract, only those subscribers associated with this contract will get the event.
- **Topic Name**: This is a required field. The events are grouped under topic.

The **Contract ID** an be provided in the RudderStack dashboard or in the `track` payload as `externalId`. If both are present, RudderStack gives higher precedence to the `externalId` .

The following is an example of sending `contractId` via a `track` call:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(
  "Ticket Closure",
  {
    name: "John Doe",
    status: "resolved",
  },
  {
    externalId: [
      {
        type: "gainsightEventContractId",
        id: "sample-contract-id",
      },
    ],
  },
  () => console.log("track callback")
)
```

### Using RudderStack's `track` call with Gainsight Events

<div class="infoBlock">
Both the event <code class="inline-code">name</code> and <code class="inline-code">version</code> are needed to use <code class="inline-code">track</code> with Gainsight Events.

</div>

First, create a new event under a particular topic in Gainsight, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/gainsightcs-event-create.png" /><span class="imageTitle">gainsightcs-event-map-sample</span>

Then, provide this event name and the version mapping in the RudderStack dashboard as shown:

<img src="../../assets/gainsightcs-event-map-sample.png" /><span class="imageTitle">gainsightcs-event-map-sample</span>

You are now ready to send events to Gainsight using the `track` method.

An example of a `track` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(
  "Ticket Closure",
  {
    name: "John Doe",
    status: "resolved",
  },
  () => console.log("track callback")
)
```

<div class="infoBlock">

To send Gainsight Events to more than one topic, we recommend creating new Gainsight destinations in the RudderStack dashboard for each topic.

</div>
