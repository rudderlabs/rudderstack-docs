# Mailchimp

[Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/) is a popular email marketing automation platform used worldwide by thousands of businesses. Built specially for eCommerce and retail, Mailchimp allows you to build your audience and send them personalized campaign and marketing messages through web or mobile.

RudderStack allows you to add people to your Mailchimp list via a simple `identify` call.

</div>

## Getting Started

Before configuring Mailchimp as a destination in RudderStack, please make sure that the source platform is supported by Mailchimp. You can refer to the following table to do so:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | -             | -             | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between Cloud mode and Device mode in RudderStack, read the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack connection modes</a> guide.

</div>

Once you have confirmed that Mailchimp supports the source type, perform the steps below:

- From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderlabs.com/), add the source and Mailchimp as a destination.

<div class="infoBlock">

Please follow our guide on <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/">How to Add a Source and Destination in RudderStack</a> to add a source and destination in RudderStack.

</div>

- Give a suitable name to the destination, and then click on **Next**. You should then see the following screen:

- Enter the relevant information in the fields such as the **Mailchimp API Key**, **Audience ID** and **DataCenter ID**. Then, click on **Next**.

<div class="infoBlock">

It is recommended that you create a new API key for your RudderStack destination. Mailchimp restricts each API key to a maximum of 10 concurrent requests. Hence, creating a dedicated key for RudderStack ensures maximum throughput for the outgoing calls. Please read more about the API keys by going to [Mailchimpâ€™s documentation](https://mailchimp.com/help/about-api-keys/).

</div>

## Identify

The `identify` call captures the details about the visiting user along with the properties associated with that user. For more information, please refer to our [RudderStack API Specification](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/) documentation.

### Adding or updating a user

Let us consider a sample `identify` call in RudderStack:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("user123", {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  email: "namesurname@domain.com"
});
```

Every time an `identify` call is made with an email address included, RudderStack performs the following steps:

- RudderStack first checks with Mailchimp whether that specific email address exists for the `listId` provided in the destination settings.
- If the email address does not exist in the list, RudderStack will subscribe the associated user to the list immediately. If the `doubleOptIn` setting is enabled, Mailchimp will send a confirmation email to that user, and that email will be tagged with a subscriber status of `pending`. The subscriber status automatically changes to `subscribed` once the user confirms the email.
- If the user already has a subscriber status such as `pending`, `subscribed`, `unsubscribed` or `cleaned`, RudderStack will **not** resubscribe them, but only update their associated user traits.

<div class="infoBlock">

For the `identify` call in RudderStack, email is a required field. The rest of the fields must match the **Merge Field** tag in Mailchimp.

</div>

### **Using custom merge fields in RudderStack**

To send custom merge fields or user traits to Mailchimp, please follow these steps:

- Create the merge field in Mailchimp for every trait you want sent to it.
- When you make the `identify` call, the keys that match the traits above will automatically appear in your Mailchimp list.

<div class="infoBlock">

The `identify` call will **not change** in this case.

</div>

### Overriding `listId`

If you have multiple lists that your users can subscribe to, you can override the default `listId`as a parameter to Mailchimp.

Consider the following code snippet:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify(
  "userId123",
  {
    email: "namesurname@domain.com"
  },
  {
    integrations: {
      MailChimp: {
        listId: "esf1rd234a"
      }
    }
  }
);
```

In the example above, we override the default `listId` with the `listId` as `esf1rd234a`

### Updating the subscription status

RudderStack gives you the option of manually updating the subscription status of a user. Simply pass on an additional parameter to Mailchimp called `subscriptionStatus`.

An example of how to do this is as shown in the code snippet below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify(
  "userId123",
  {
    email: "namesurname@domain.com"
  },
  {
    integrations: {
      MailChimp: {
        subscriptionStatus: "unsubscribed"
      }
    }
  }
);
```

<div class="infoBlock">

Please note that this setting will **NOT** work for new users. New users will always have the subscription status set for them as either `pending` or `subscribed` , depending on the set `doubleOptIn` setting.

</div>
