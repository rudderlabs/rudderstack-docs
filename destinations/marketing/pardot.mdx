</div>

## Getting started

Before configuring Pardot as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Pardot by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | -             | -             | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</a> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Pardot, follow these steps:

- From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Pardot**.

## Connection settings

To successfully configure Pardot as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

- **Public API Key**: Your Public API Key is the unique key generated against your Klaviyo account. It can be found in your Klaviyo dashboard in the **Account** section under **Settings**.

- **Private API Key**: Your Private API key can be generated for your account in the **Account** section under **Settings**. This key allows you to add users to a list or subscribe them using personalised emails/SMS.

- **Enforce Email as Primary Identifier**: If this option is enabled, RudderStack will never set `$id` field to your `userId` when you send the events. Instead, RudderStack will only set a custom attribute `_id` and `$email` as the primary identifier with your `traits.email` or `properties.email`. 

<div class="warningBlock">

This setting should be enabled only if you are experiencing any issues with duplicate profiles created in your Klaviyo account.
</div>

- **List Id**: Enter your default list ID to which you want to add or subscribe your identified users.

- **Consent**: If you are a GDPR-compliant business, you will need to include `consent` in your API call. 

<div class="infoBlock">

<code class="inline-code">consent</code> is a Klaviyo-specific property and only accepts these values: <code class="inline-code">email</code>, <code class="inline-code">web</code>, <code class="inline-code">sms</code>, <code class="inline-code">directmail</code>, and <code class="inline-code">mobile</code>. 
</div>

- **SMS Consent**: If you are updating the consent for a phone number, or would like to send an opt-in SMS to the profile \(for double opt-in lists\), then enable this option. Alternatively, you can also include an `smsConsent` key in the properties with a value of `true` or `false`.

- **Send Page As Track**: Enable this option if you wish send `page` events as `track` events along with the event `name` and `category`.

- **Additional Page info**: If you are sending `page` events as `track` events, you can also choose to send in additional properties for the event by enabling this field.

- **Use Native SDK to send Events**: Enable this option if you want to send events using the web device mode.

<div class="infoBlock">

In case <code class="inline-code">userId</code> is absent, RudderStack uses <code class="inline-code">anonymousId</code> for mapping the user with an unique identifier. In case both <code class="inline-code">userId</code> and <code class="inline-code">anonymousId</code> are absent, then <code class="inline-code">email</code> or <code class="inline-code">phone</code> will be considered as the user's primary identifier.
</div>

## Identify

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack supports only <code class="inline-code">identify</code> event type for this destination.
</div>

The `identify` call lets you identify a visiting user and associate them to their actions. It also lets you record the traits about them like their name, email address, etc.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the <code class="inline-code">identify</code> call, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/identify/">RudderStack Events Specification</a> guide.
</div>

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
{
  "message": {
    "traits": {
      "property-1": "abc",
      "property-2": "def",
      ..........
      ..........
      "id": "test id",
      "fid": "test fid",
      "email": "testEmail@example.com"

    }
  }
}
```
