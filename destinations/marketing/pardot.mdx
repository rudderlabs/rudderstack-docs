It is a marketing automation solution that enables organizations to track and measure the effectiveness of their communications, gain insight into user behavior, and personalize content across campaigns based on any specific criteria.

</div>

## Getting started

Before configuring Pardot as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Pardot by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | -             | -             | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</a> guide.

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Pardot, follow these steps:

- From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Pardot**.

## Connection settings

To successfully configure Pardot as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/pardot-connection-settings3.png" alt="Pardot connection settings"/>

- **Business Unit Id**: You can find the Business Unit ID by logging in into Salesforce. 
1. Go to Setup at the top right corner and click on **Pardot** option. 
2. Click on **Pardot Account Setup**.
You can locate the Business Unit ID, which is the 18 character long string starting with `0Uv`ˇ

- **Campaign Id**: You can find the Campaign ID (or piCId) under **Marketing** > **Campaigns** in your Pardot account. After selecting the desired website campaign, press **View Tracking Code**.

Alternatively, you can go to the [Pardot campaigns](https://pi.pardot.com/campaign) and select the desired campaign from the list. The last 5 digits in the campaign Url is your campaign Id. For example, 12345 is the campaign Id in URL: https://pi.pardot.com/campaign/read/id/12345. 


## Identify

The `identify` call lets you capture the details of a visiting user along with any associated traits such as their name, email address, etc.

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("userId", {
  "active_seats": 6,
  "salutation": "Mrs",
  "firstName": "Angela",
  "lastName": "Rudder",
  "email": "angela@rudder.com",
  "website": "https://app.rudderstack.com",
  "score": 16,
  "company": "Rudderstack",
  "job_title": "dev",
  "department": "accounting",
  "country": "IN",
  "address": {
    "street": "dwight",
    "city": "schrute",
    "state": "Bihar",
    "zip": "123456"
  },
  "phone": "+911234567890",
  "annual_revenue": "100001",
  "employees": "100001",
  "industry": "people",
  "notes": "take notes",
  "address_two": "address two of angela differnet secrets",
  "fax": "fax321",
  "years_in_business": 13,
  "comments": "good",
  "is_do_not_email": "false",
  "opted_out": "false",
  "is_reviewed": "false",
  "is_starred": "true",
  "territory": "territory",
  "campaign_id": 41775
}, {
  externalId: [{
    type: "crmfid", // can be pardotid for sending pardot ID
    id: "crmFidUser",
  }]
});
```


in above example if email and crmfid both are absent error will be thrown.
If email is absent but either pardotid or crmfid is present update API will be performed. ( Note that if pardotid and crmfid is not already linked to prospect then pardot will throw error)
If only email is present then we will always create new prospect. Even if that email is already present, pardot will create new prospect.
if no email is present and prospect id or crm fid is wrongly input error will be thrown from destination end
If only email address is provided, and even if Pardot already contains more than one prospect with the same email id, a new prospect will be created as Pardot does not allow write operation on email addresses.

### How to update a prospect data?

To update the prospect data, you need to send a payload that contains `externalId` in `context` property of the payload. An example snippet of the payload is shown below:
```javascript
// Sample payload with `id` data for update
{
  "externalId": [{
    "type": "PardotId",
    "id": "12345",
  }]
}
```
The `type` field can contain either of the below mentioned values:
- Pardot Id with field name as `pardotid`
- CRM FID with field name as `crmfid`
The `id` field contains the actual value
