# Intercom

[Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/) is an industry-leading, real-time business messaging platform, that allows you to bring together and manage all your customer life cycle activities on a single platform.

RudderStack allows you to send your event data from a variety of sources to Intercom through S2S and native SDKs by calling the relevant APIs.

<div class="warningBlock">

**Please note that this documentation is written for Intercom v1.4.**

</div>

<div class="successBlock">

  **Find the open-source transformer code for this destination in our <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/v0/destinations/intercom">GitHub repo</a>.**
</div>

## Getting Started

To enable sending events to Intercom, you will first need to add it as a destination to the source from which you are sending event data. Please check if the source platform is supported by Intercom by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**             |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :--------------------- |
| **Device mode**     | **Supported** | **Supported** | -                      |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | -             | **Supported**          |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between Cloud mode and Device mode in RudderStack, read the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack connection modes</a> guide.

</div>

Once you have ascertained that the source platform is supported by Intercom, please follow these steps:

- From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderlabs.com/), add the source and select **Intercom** from the list of supported destinations.

<div class="infoBlock">

Please follow our guide on <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/">How to Add a Source and Destination in RudderStack</a> to add a source and destination in RudderStack.

</div>

- Give a name to the destination, and click on **Next**. You should then see the following screen:

<img src="../../assets/Intercom-v2.png" /><span class="imageTitle">Connection screen for Intercom</span>

Enter the relevant keys in the fields above by obtaining them from the following locations:

- **API Key**: This is required for all the S2S \(Server to Server\) events. This can be obtained by going to Intercom **Settings** - **Developers** - **Developer Hub** - &lt;Your App&gt; - **Configure** - **Authentication**.
- **App ID**: This is required for sending events via `rudderanalytics.js` and mobile SDKs. You can get it from Intercom **Settings** - **Installation** - &lt;the desired platform&gt; Alternatively, you can follow the instructions listed [here](https://www.intercom.com/help/en/articles/3539-where-can-i-find-my-workspace-id-app-id).
- **Android API Key & iOS API Key**: This is required for sending events from your mobile apps to Intercom. You can get it from Intercom **Settings** - **Installation** - &lt;the desired platform&gt;
- **Send AnonymousId as Secondary UserId**: This is required for sending the `anonymousId` as user ID to Intercom when the `userId` is absent from the input payload. This is helpful for tracking anonymous users of your site.

## **Adding Intercom to your project**

## Identify

The `identify` call captures the details about a visiting user. For more information, please refer to our [RudderStack API Specification](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/) guide.

A sample`identify` call in RudderStack looks like the following code snippet:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("tp4r23", {
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john@doe.com",
  company: {
    id: "company123",
    name: "John Doe Inc.",
  },
  createdAt: "Mon May 19 2019 18:34:24 GMT+0000 (UTC)",
})
```

The `identify` call can be used to :

- **Create / Update a user** : When you make an`identify` call, RudderStack creates or updates a user in Intercom using their [Users API](https://developers.intercom.com/reference#users).
- **Remove users from a company** : To remove users from a company, you must pass `remove: true` inside the company object.
- **Unsubscribe users** : To unsubscribe users from emails, `unsubscribedFromEmails: true` must be passed inside `context` object.

<div class="infoBlock">

The **Last Seen** feature of the <code class="inline-code">identify</code> call has not been implemented yet. Please stay tuned!

</div>

The following RudderStack properties are matched to Intercom's properties -

| RudderStack Property | Intercom iOS Property | Intercom Android Property |
| :------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------ |
| `traits.userId`      | `user_id`             | `user_id`                 |
| `traits.email`       | `email`               | `email`                   |
| `traits.name`        | `name`                | name                      |
| `traits.phone`       | `phone`               | `phone`                   |
| `traits.company`     | `company`             | `company`                 |
| `traits.createdAt`   | `signedUpAt`          | `signed_up_at`            |

### Collect Context

On enabling the **Collect Context** option in the RudderStack dashboard for Intercom, events are collected through the mobile libraries \(if available\).

The collected events are : - `device.type` , `device.model`, `device.manufacturer`, `os.name,` `os.version` , `app.name`, and `app.version`

## Track

The `track` call captures information related to the actions performed by the user, along with all the other properties associated with that action or event. For more information, please refer to our [RudderStack API Specification](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/) guide.

The following code snippet is an example of a `track` call in RudderStack:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Product bought", {
  order_ID: "140021222",
  category: "shoes",
  product_name: "sports_shoes",
  price: 199.95,
  currency: "USD",
})
```

<div class="infoBlock">

All the traits provided in the <code class="">track</code> call will be converted as per <a href="https://developers.intercom.com/intercom-api-reference/reference#event-metadata-types">Intercom's API</a>.

</div>

## Page

The `page` call contains information such as the URL or the web page visited by the user. For more information, please refer to our [RudderStack API Specification](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/) guide.

The `page` call works only through our `rudderanalytics.js` and is not supported by other sources. It works by triggering Intercom's `update` method, which looks for a list of new conversations that are open and should be displayed to the current user.

A sample `page` call in RudderStack looks like the following code snippet:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page()
```

## Reset

The reset method resets the previously identified user and the related information. For more information, please refer to our [RudderStack API Specification](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/) guide.

## Implementing push notifications and deep linking

None of our SDKs support push notifications at this point of time. Refer to the [Intercom documentation](https://developers.intercom.com/installing-intercom/docs) for more information on how to set these features up for your project.

## FAQs

### How do I get the Intercom API key?

You can obtain the Intercom API key by logging into Intercom and navigating to **Settings** - **Developers** - **Developer Hub** - **&lt;Your App&gt;** - **Configure** - **Authentication**. Please check the Getting Started section above for details.

### What happens when both userId or email is missing?

### What happens when both userId or email is missing?

For both identify and track calls either `userId` or `email` is a mandatory field. In case they are missing, RudderStack will drop the event. It is recommended to set <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/destinations/marketing/intercom/##Getting Started">Send AnonymousId as Secondary UserId</a> from your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderlabs.com/) to `true` in such scenarios, to avoid event loss.
