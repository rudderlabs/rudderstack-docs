# TikTok Ads

TikTok Ads is TikTok's online advertising platform. It allows marketers to run their product ads to target custom audiences, optimize their campaigns, attribution, etc.

RudderStack supports TikTok Ads as a destination where you can send your event data seamlessly.

</div>

## Getting started

Before configuring TikTok Ads as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by TikTok Ads by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     |  -            | -             | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | -             | -             |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</a> guide.

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to TikTok Ads, follow these steps:

- From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **TikTok Ads**.

## Connection settings

To successfully configure TikTok Ads as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

- **Access Token**: You need to generate the Access Token (also known as long-term access token) by following the steps mentioned in <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1701890912382977">Authorization</a> and <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1701890914536450">Authentication</a> in TikTok documentation.

- **Pixel Code**: You can find the Pixel Code by referring to <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1701890912382977">TikTok documentation</a>.

- **Hash Contextual User Properties (SHA-256)**: If this setting is enabled, RudderStack will hash the contextual user properties like external_id, email, phone_number from raw format to sha256.

### Track

The `track` call allows you to capture user actions along with the properties associated with these actions. Each action is considered to be an event.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(
  "checkout started", {
    eventId: "1616318632825_357",
    context: {
      ad: {
        callback: "123ATXSfe"
      }
    },
    currency: "USD",
    value: 46.0
  }, {
    externalId: [{
      type: "tiktokExternalId",
      id: "f0e388f53921a51f0bb0fc8a2944109ec188b59172935d8f23020b1614cc44bc"
    }]
  }
);
```
<div class="infoBlock">

The events are automatically grouped in a batch of 50 events per request using the `batch` call. However, if the event payload contains **test_event_code** property, batching won't be applied. For more information about the `batch` call, please refer to the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/http-api/#11-batch">RudderStack API Specification</a>documentation.
