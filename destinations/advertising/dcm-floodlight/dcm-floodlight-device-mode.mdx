# Device Mode

RudderStack lets you send your event data to DCM Floodlight destination via the device mode using the native web SDK. RudderStack uses global site tagging in device mode.

<div class="successBlock">

Find the open-source transformer code for this destination in the <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-js/tree/production/integrations/dcm_floodlight/">GitHub repository</a>.
</div>



The mappings for the above parameters are listed in the following table:

| Parameters    | Description | Mapping value  |
| :-------------| :-----------------|:-----------------|
| `google_hm`   | Contains data that the bidder wants to store in a Google-hosted match table | `anonymousId` (Converts it to Base64-encoded ASCII string)  |


## Track

The [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/track/) call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.

A sample `track` call is as shown below:

```javascript
client.track({
  userId: "1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm",
  event: "Checkout Started",
  properties: {
    orderId: 1234,
    quantity: 45,
    revenue: 800,
  },
  context: {
    device: {
      advertisingId: "2a3e36d172-5e28-45a1-9eda-ce22a3e36d1a",
    },
    userAgent: "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_2) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/79.0.3945.88 Safari/537.36",
  },
  integrations: {
    All: true,
    "DCM Floodlight": {
      COPPA: "false",
      GDPR: "1",
      npa: "true",
    },
  },
});
```

The following table details the mapping of `integrations` object (as seen in the above code snippet) for DCM Floodlight:

| **RudderStack property** | **DCM Floodlight property** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :---|
| `COPPA`| `tag_for_child_directed_treatment`  | Imposes requirements on the websites/online services operators directed to children under 13 years of age. More reference [here](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/children%27s-privacy). |
| `GDPR` | `tfua` |  EU law on general data protection and privacy. More reference [here](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679). |
| `npa` | `npa` | Law catering to users to wish to opt-out of remarketing. | 

The following table details the mapping between RudderStack and DCM Floodlight properties:

| **RudderStack property** | **DCM Floodlight property** | **Presence**| **Tag**|
| :--- | :--- |:--- |:--- |
| `context.device.advertisingId` | `dc_rdid` | Optional | Counter/Sales|
| `context.device.adTrackingEnabled` | `dc_lat` | Optional |Counter/Sales|
| `messageId` | `ord` | Optional | Counter |
| `properties.orderId` | `ord` | Optional | Sales |
| `properties.quantity` | `qty` | Optional | Sales |
| `properties.revenue` | `cost` | Optional | Sales |

<div class="infoBlock">
    
You must send the device-specific information for DCM Floodlight like <code class="inline-code">IDFA</code> or <code class="inline-code">advertisingId</code>, which are mapped to the <code class="inline-code">context.device.advertisingId</code>. You can do this using RudderStack's mobile SDKs as they collect this information automatically.
    
However, in case you are using a RudderStack server-side SDK, the <code class="inline-code">advertisingId</code> needs to be included manually.
</div>

The following table gives some more context on the above DCM Floodlight properties:

| DCM Floodlight property | Description |
| :----| :-----|
| `dc_rdid` |  The IDFA or Android Advertising ID to be passed over SSL. |
| `dc_lat` | Indicates if the user has enabled the **Limited Ad Tracking** option for IDFA/Android Advertising ID. |
| `ord` | Used to make the Floodlight tag unique and prevent browser caching. |
| `qty` | Applicable for **Sales** tags only - RudderStack adds the quantity of all the products in the `products` array or refers to the top-level `quantity` property. |
| `cost` | Applicable for **Sales** tags only - RudderStack sends the `revenue` parameter to DCM Floodlight. |

## Page

The [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/page/) call lets you record your website's page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.

If the `category` and `name` fields are passed in the `page` call, it is passed as - Viewed CATEGORY NAME PAGE NAME Page
