# Criteo

[**Criteo**](https://www.criteo.com/) is a popular online display advertising platform that offers various solutions to increase your website traffic. It also helps you generate brand awareness and boost sales, conversions, and app installs.

RudderStack supports Criteo as a destination to which you can send your event data directly.

## Getting Started

Before configuring Criteo as a destination in RudderStack, verify if Criteo supports the source platform you are sending the events from. Refer to the following table:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :--------- | :--------- |
| **Device mode**     | **Supported** | -          | -          |
| **Cloud mode**      | -             | -          | -          |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between Cloud mode and Device mode in RudderStack, read the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack connection modes</a> guide.

</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Criteo, follow these steps:

- From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source and select **Criteo** from the list of destinations.

<div class="infoBlock">

Follow our guide on <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/">How to Add a Source and Destination in RudderStack</a> for more information.

### Configuration Settings

To successfully configure Criteo as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

- **Criteo Account ID:** Enter your Criteo Account ID or Partner ID here.

<div class="infoBlock">

Refer to the **FAQ** section below for more information on getting your Account/Partner ID.

</div>

- **Home Page URL:** Enter the complete URL of your websiteâ€™s homepage. This is useful when the **homepage tag** needs to be fired to add visitors to your target audience.

<div class="infoBlock">

This field is required when you need to fire the homepage tag in cases where the event name of the <code class="inline-code">page</code> call is anything other than <code class="inline-code">home</code>.

</div>

- **Email Hashing Method:** Criteo lets you use the email addresses in both hashed and non-hashed formats. If **MD5** is chosen as an option, RudderStack will hash-encode the email address.
- **Map Specific Fields to Criteo Fields:** Enter the payload fields and the corresponding mapped fields that will be used to send the event data to Criteo.

<div class="infoBlock">

Criteo events allow you to send any extra data about a page or a user to add more context to the events. You can set this feature in Criteo with the assistance of your Criteo Account Manager. You can then use the **Map Specific Fields to Criteo Fields** field mapping feature to send extra data through RudderStack.

</div>

## Page

The `page` call lets you track the user's home page along with its associated properties.

<div class="infoBlock">

Use this call only to track the home page and add the users to your target audience.

</div>

The home page tag will be fired in the following three scenarios:

- When the name of the `page` call is `home`.
- When the current URL of the web page is same as the **Home Page URL** specified in the RudderStack dashboard.
- When the URL mentioned in the `properties` of the `page` call is same as the **Home Page URL** specified in the RudderStack dashboard.

<div class="warningBlock">

The home page tag will **not** be fired in any other scenario.

</div>

A sample `page` call is as shown below:

```javascript
window.rudderanalytics.page("category", "home", {
  path: "path",
  url: "url",
  title: "title",
  search: "search",
  referrer: "referrer",
  testDimension: "true",
})
```

## Track

The `track` call lets you capture any user action and the properties associated with it. Each action is considered to be an event.

A sample `track` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Product Viewed", {
  product_id: "Prod12345",
  quantity: 1,
  price: 19.99,
  name: "my product",
  category: "categ 1",
  sku: "p-666",
  list: "Gallery",
  testDimension: true,
  testMetric: true,
})
```

In this snippet, RudderStack captures the information related to the `Product Viewed` event and the associated details such as quantity, price, category, etc.

The following table details the mapping of the [**Rudderstack E-Commerce events**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-ecommerce-events-specification/) and the [**Criteo OneTag events**](https://support.criteo.com/s/article?article=All-Criteo-OneTag-events-and-parameters&language=en_US).

| **Rudderstack E-Commerce Event** | **Criteo OneTag Event**               | **OneTag Event Name Used By Criteo** |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------- |
| `Product Viewed`                 | `Product tag`                         | `viewItem`                           |
| `Cart Viewed`                    | `Basket/cart tag`                     | `viewBasket`                         |
| `Order Completed`                | `Sales Tag`                           | `trackTransaction`                   |
| `Product List Viewed`            | `Category/keyword search/listing tag` | `viewList`                           |

<div class="infoBlock">

If the <code class="inline-code">Category/keyword search/listing tag</code> needs to be fired with the filters, enter it within the <code class="inline-code">filters</code> field of the <code class="inline-code">properties</code> inside the <code class="inline-code">Product List Viewed</code> tag.

</div>

The `filters` field is an array of objects that consists of each filter category in every single object. Criteo expects `name`, `operator,` and `value` fields for every filter that needs to be passed to Criteo.

For example, a simple `Product List Viewed` event that fires a `Category/keyword search/listing Tag` is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Product List Viewed", {
  email: "name@domain.com",
  zipCode: "12345",
  category: "abc",
  keywords: "key",
  page_number: 1,
  filters: [
    {
      name: "processor",
      operator: "eq",
      value: "snapdragon",
    },
  ],
  products: [
    {
      product_id: "223344ffdds3ff3",
    },
    {
      product_id: "343344ff5567ff3",
    },
  ],
})
```
