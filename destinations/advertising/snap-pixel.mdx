# Snap Pixel

The [**Snap Pixel**](https://ads.snapchat.com/) is a piece of JavaScript code that lets you measure the cross-device impact of your advertising campaigns. It lets you understand how many Snapchat users interact with your website after seeing the ads.

RudderStack supports Snap Pixel as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your event data.

## Getting Started

Before configuring Snap Pixel as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Snap Pixel by referring to the table below: ̦

| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Device mode** | **Supported** | - | - |
| **Cloud mode** | - | - | - |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between Cloud mode and Device mode in RudderStack, refer to the [**RudderStack connection modes**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/) guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Snap Pixel, perform the steps below:

* From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **Snap Pixel**.

<div class="infoBlock">

Follow our guide on [**How to Add a Source and Destination in RudderStack**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/) for more information.
</div>

* Assign a name to the destination and click on **Next**. You should then see the following screen:

### Configuration Settings

To successfully configure Snap Pixel as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

* **Snap Pixel ID:** Enter your Snap Pixel ID here. To get your Snap Pixel ID, go to your [**Snap Ads Manager**](https://ads.snapchat.com/) account. Under **Events Manager**, select **View Pixel Details** then **Setup Pixel**. You can find the Pixel ID under **Pixel Code**, as shown:

**Hashing Method:** Snap Pixel lets you pass a user parameter \(email or phone number\) in both hashed and non-hashed format during intialization. If **SHA-256** is chosen as an option, RudderStack will hash-encode the provided user parameter.

## Identify

<div class="warningBlock">

The Snap Pixel will not be initialized unless the `identify` call is fired.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStacks checks the cookies for the user parameter \(email or phone number\) before loading the Snap Pixel snippet. If found, the snippet is loaded. Otherwise, an `identify` call with the user's email or phone number is required to load the snippet.
</div>

In Snap Pixel, the `identify` call initializes the Snap Pixel code.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the `identify` call, check out the [**RudderStack API spec**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/identify/).
</div>

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
    rudderanalytics.identify({
        email: "alex@example.com",
        phone: "+1-202-555-0146"
    });
```

Either or both of the user parameters should be passed in the `identify` call. The following table lists the parameters along with the relative mapping to the Snap Pixel parameters:

| **RudderStack User Parameter** | **Snap Pixel User Parameter** |
| :--- | :--- |
| `email` | `user_email` |
| `phone` | `user_phone_number` |

## Page

When the `page` call is made, RudderStack sends the following:

`snaptr("track", "PAGE_VIEW")`.

You can make the `page` call with or without the event payload.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the `page` call, check out the [**RudderStack API spec**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/page/).
</div>

A sample `page` call is as shown:

```javascript
    rudderanalytics.page();
```

## Track

The `track` call lets you send Snap Pixel events.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the `track` call, check out the [**RudderStack API spec**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/track/).
</div>

A sample `track` call is as shown below:

```javascript
    rudderanalytics.track('PURCHASE', {
        'currency': 'USD',
        'price': 333.33,
        'transaction_id': '11111111'
    });
```

You can also send the following RudderStack e-commerce events:

| **RudderStack event** | **Snap Pixel event** |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Order Completed` | `PURCHASE` |
| `Checkout Started` | `START_CHECKOUT` |
| `Product Added` | `ADD_CART` |
| `Payment Info Entered` | `ADD_BILLING` |
| `Promotion Clicked` | `AD_CLICK` |
| `Promotion Viewed` | `AD_VIEW` |
| `Product Added To Wishlist` | `ADD_TO_WISHLIST` |
| `Product Viewed` | `VIEW_CONTENT` |
| `Product List Viewed` | `VIEW_CONTENT` |
| `Products Searched` | `SEARCH` |

<div class="infoBlock">

</div>
