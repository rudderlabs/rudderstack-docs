# Facebook Custom Audience

[**Facebook Custom Audience**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/audiences/guides/custom-audiences) is a popular targeting tool that lets you find people on Facebook, who are interested in your business. It lets you create custom audiences through customer lists, Facebook engagement, and website/app traffic.

RudderStack lets you send your customer events for creating custom audiences by leveraging the Facebook Marketing API.

You can now send your customer events data list directly for adding them to already created Facebook Custom Audience through RudderStack.

<div class="infoBlock">

The user information in your events may include email, phone number, gender, etc. For more information on the supported fields, refer the documentation <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/audiences/guides/custom-audiences#hash">here</a>.

</div>

<div class="successBlock">

 <strong>Find the open-source transformer code for this destination in our <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/v0/destinations/fb_custom_audience">GitHub repo</a></strong>.
</div>

## Getting started

To enable sending your event data to Facebook Custom Audience, you will first need to add it as a destination in RudderStack.Once the destination is configured and enabled, events from RudderStack will start flowing to Custom Audience.

Before configuring Facebook Custom Audience as a destination, verify if the source platform supports sending events to Custom Audience by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------ | :--------- | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | -       | -          | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | -       | -          | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between Cloud mode and Device mode in RudderStack, read the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</a> guide.

</div>

Once you have confirmed that the platform supports sending events to Custom Audience, perform the steps below:

- From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com), add the source. Then, select **Facebook Custom Audience** from the list of destinations.

<div class="infoBlock">

Follow our guide on <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/">Adding a Source and Destination in RudderStack</a> for more information.
</div>

- Assign a name to the destination and click on **Next**. You will then see the following screen:



### Connection settings

To add Custom Audience as a destination in RudderStack, you will need to configure the following settings:

<img src="../assets/event-stream-destinations/Fb-custom-audience-connection-settings-2.png" /><span class="imageTitle">Facebook Custom Audience Setup</span>


- **Access Token**: Enter the access token of your business application set up for accessing the Facebook Marketing API.

<div class="infoBlock">

  Check the <strong>FAQ</strong> section for more information on how to find your User Access Token.
</div>

- **Audience ID**: This is the custom Audience ID to which the audiences will be added/removed.

<div class="infoBlock">

  Check the <strong>FAQ</strong> section for more information on how to find your Audience ID.
</div>

- **Schema Fields** Choose your schema fields \(at least one\) from the available options. **This is a mandatory field**. RudderStack expects the user events to consist of **every** schema field that has been chosen on the dashboard.

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack will ignore any user information which does not adhere to the schema fields specified in the dashboard settings.
</div>

Some other important settings include:

- **Enable Hashing**: Facebook expects the user data to be hash encoded using `SHA256`. if this option is enabled, RudderStack will hash encode the user data irrespective of the schema type chosen in the RudderStack dashboard.

- **Is The Data Raw**: As RudderStack does not support combinational schema fields, this field will be ignored if not enabled.

<div class="warningBlock">

When this option is enabled, Facebook will not support the following schema fields:
  
  <ul>
    <li><code class="inline-code">EMAIL_SHA256</code></li>
    <li><code class="inline-code">PHONE_SHA256</code></li>
  </ul>
  
Even when disabled, Facebook does not accept any other schema fields coupled with the above fields.
</div>

- **Audience Batch Size**: Specify the size of data you want RudderStack to send to Facebook in a single event. For example, if you want to send a total 1000 user records to Facebook and set the batch size to 50, then Rudderstack will send 20 events to Facebook with 50 user records in each event.

- **Disable Formatting**: Facebook has fixed data formats for all the allowed schema fields. If this option is enabled, RudderStack will not format the user data before sending it to Custom Audience.

- **Skip Verify**: The following behavior can be observed depending on the setting:
    - When false, no impact
    - When true, the null values are replaced by empty string “”, hashed and sent
    - When true and **Enable Hashing** is false, Facebook throws an error as it does not take null values

- **Type**: Specify the type of the custom audience here. This field will be ignored if left as `NA`.

- **Sub Type**: This is the sub-type of the custom audience. This field will be ignored if left as `NA`.

## `audiencelist` event structure to send user data to Custom Audience

<div class="warningBlock">

<strong>The Facebook Custom Audience destination supports only <code class="inline-code">audiencelist</code> calls.</strong>
</div>

The `add` and `remove` arrays containing the user data objects are expected inside the properties field of the `audiencelist` event. These arrays are wrapped inside the object `listData`.

- **add**: This array refers to the user information that needs to be added to Custom Audience.
- **remove**: This array refers to the user information that needs to be deleted from Custom Audience.

## Schema fields mapping

The following table details the mapping of the schema fields specified in the [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderlabs.com/) and the Facebook Marketing API.

| **Dashboard Field Name** | **Marketing API Schema Field \(Rudderstack Supported Field Name\)** | **Field Guidelines**                                                                                                                                                         |

## Explicit formatting feature

If the **Disable Formatting** option is enabled in the RudderStack dashboard, RudderStack will not format the user data in the format prescribed by the Facebook Marketing API. If it is disabled, RudderStack formats the schema fields input by the user as shown in the table below:

| **Schema Field Name** | **Example Input** | **Formatted Output \(Before Hashing\)** |
| :-------------------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `EMAIL`               | `ABC@gmail.com`   | `abc@gmail.com`                         |
| `PHONE`               | `0@96346895`      | `96346895`                              |
| `GEN`                 | `FEMALE`          | `f`                                     |
| `DOBD`                | `2`               | `02`                                    |
| `DOBM`                | `1`               | `01`                                    |
| `LN & FN`             | `Abc,@`           | `abc@`                                  |
| `FI`                  | `Mr.`             | `mr.`                                   |
| `CT`                  | `HN#`             | `hn`                                    |

| `COUNTRY`             | `IN`              | `in`                                    |

The following code snippet shows a `audiencelist` event with the schema fields \(e.g.`EMAIL`,`FIRST NAME`\) specified in the RudderStack dashboard:

```JSON
{
  "type": "audiencelist",
  "properties": {
    "listData": {
      "add": [{
          "EMAIL": "name1@abc.com",
          "FN": "name1"
        },
        {
          "EMAIL": " 'name2@abc.com",
          "FN": "name2"
        },
        {
          "EMAIL": " 'name3@abc.com",
          "FN": "name3"
        }
      ],
      "remove": [{
          "EMAIL": "'name4@abc.com",
          "FN": "name4"
        },
        {
          "EMAIL": "'name5@abc.com",
          "FN": "name5"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Facebook Custom Audience payload restrictions

| **Payload Field**                 | **Transformed?** |
| :-------------------------------- | :--------------- |
| Using only `add`                  | Yes              |
| Using only `remove`               | Yes              |
| Using both `add` and `remove`     | Yes              |
| Not using both `add` and `remove` | No               |

The following code snippet shows a `audiencelist` event having only `add` with the schema fields \(e.g.`EMAIL`,`FIRST NAME`\) specified in the RudderStack dashboard:

```JSON
{
  "type": "audiencelist",
  "properties": {
    "listData": {
      "add": [{
          "EMAIL": 'name1@abc.com',
          "FN": 'name1'
        },
        {
          "EMAIL": 'name2@abc.com',
          "FN": 'name2'
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

<div class="infoBlock">

Similarly, you can use <code class="inline-code">remove</code> in order to remove users from a particular custom audience without creating a session.
</div>

<div class="warningBlock">

The event payload must include <code class="inline-code">add</code> or <code class="inline-code">remove</code> . Otherwise, the user data won’t be transformed and sent to Custom Audience.
</div>

### Should I use `sessionIdAdd` or `sessionIdDelete` before adding/removing users in Custom Audience?

`sessionIdAdd` and `sessionIdDelete` helps you track and use a particular session ID while adding or removing users. This is useful when you are sending data in chunks. If you do not include these fields, Facebook creates a session ID itself.

Refer to the [**Facebook documentation**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/audiences/guides/custom-audiences#step-2--specify-a-list-of-users) for more information on this.
