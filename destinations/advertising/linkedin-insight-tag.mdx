# LinkedIn Insight Tag

The [**LinkedIn Insight Tag**](https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/insight-tag) is a JavaScript code for your website that lets you learn more about your customers and optimize your marketing campaigns. You can also use the LinkedIn Insight Tag to track your conversions and retarget your website visitors and customers who interact with your ads.

RudderStack lets you send your user events directly to LinkedIn by supporting LinkedIn Insight Tag as a destination.

  **Find the open-source code for this destination in our <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-js/tree/production/integrations">GitHub repo</a>.**
</div>

## Integration Workflow

The following flow explains how this integration works:

- The user configures **LinkedIn Insight Tag** as a destination in RudderStack.
- The user loads the RudderStack JavaScript SDK on their website.
- The JavaScript SDK automatically loads the Insight Tag tracking code.

If you are already using LinkedIn Insight Tag on your website, we highly recommend you remove it.

The LinkedIn Insight Tag lets you collect the data related to your members' website visit, including the URL, IP Address, referrer, device and browser characteristics, and timestamp.

    The RudderStack SDK loads asynchronously with your website. When loading the
    LinkedIn Insight Tag tracking snippet, it will not slow down your website's
    performance at all.

## Getting started

To enable sending your event data to LinkedIn Insight Tag, you will first need to add it as a destination in RudderStack.

<div class="warningBlock">

This integration is a Device mode-only destination for the web (JavaScript) source. For more information on what a Device mode is, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</a> guide.

</div>

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile** | **Server** |

| **Cloud mode**      | -             | -          | -          |
