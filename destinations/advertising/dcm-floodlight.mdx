# DCM Floodlight

**DCM Floodlight** is a conversion tracking system for [Google Marketing Platform](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/). It lets you track the users' activity on your site, compiles their list, adds conversion data to your reports, and then targets those users by subsequent campaigns.

    - **Sales tag**: Same as counter tag except it is supposed to be placed on the confirmation page after a sale with information about the sales, like `cost`,`qty`,`ord` passed to the tag. Enable the toggle button if it is a Sales tag.

- **Custom Floodlight variables:** Enter the custom Floodlight variables which will be mapped to the RudderStack event properties.

## Track

The `track` call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.

A sample `track` call is as shown below:

```javascript
client.track({
  userId: "1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm",
  event: "Checkout Started",
  properties: {
    orderId: 1234,
    quantity: 45,
    revenue: 800,
  },
  context: {
    device: {
      advertisingId: "2a3e36d172-5e28-45a1-9eda-ce22a3e36d1a",
    },

    "DCM Floodlight": {
      COPPA: "false",

      npa: "true",
    },
