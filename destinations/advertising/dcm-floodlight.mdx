# DCM Floodlight

**DCM Floodlight** is a conversion tracking system for [Google Marketing Platform](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/). It lets you track the users' activity on your site, compiles their list, adds conversion data to your reports, and then targets those users by subsequent campaigns.

## Getting Started

Before configuring DCM Floodlight as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by DCM Floodlight by referring to the table below: ̦

- **RudderStack Event Name:** Enter your RudderStack event name which will be mapped to the Floodlight tag.
- **Floodlight Activity Tag:** Enter the `cat` of your tag string. If left blank, RudderStack will pick the value defined in the **Activity Tag** field above.
- **Floodlight Group Tag:** Enter the `type` of your tag string. If left blank, RudderStack will pick the value defined in the **Group Tag** field above.
- **Fire as Sales Tag:** Enable the toggle button if the tag is a Sales tag. Keep it disabled in case of a Counter tag.

## Identify

<div class="warningBlock">

The Snap Pixel will not be initialized unless the `identify` call is fired.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStacks checks the cookies for the user parameter \(email or phone number\) before loading the Snap Pixel snippet. If found, the snippet is loaded. Otherwise, an `identify` call with the user's email or phone number is required to load the snippet.
</div>

In Snap Pixel, the `identify` call initializes the Snap Pixel code.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the `identify` call, check out the [**RudderStack API spec**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/identify/).
</div>

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
    rudderanalytics.identify({
        email: "sample@sample.com",
        phone: "8787857564"
    });
```

Either or both of the user parameters should be passed in the `identify` call. The following table lists the parameters along with the relative mapping to the Snap Pixel parameters:

| **RudderStack User Parameter** | **Snap Pixel User Parameter** |
| :--- | :--- |
| `email` | `user_email` |
| `phone` | `user_phone_number` |



## Track

The `track` call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the `track` call, check out the [**RudderStack API spec**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/track/).
</div>

A sample `track` call is as shown below:

```javascript
    rudderanalytics.track('PURCHASE', {
        'currency': 'USD',
        'price': 333.33,
        'transaction_id': '11111111'
    });
```

You can also send the following RudderStack E-Commerce Events:

</div>

## Group

The group call lets you link an identified user with a group, such as a company, organization, or an account. It also lets you record any custom traits associated with that group, such as the name of the company, the number of employees, etc.

A sample `group` call is as shown:

```javascript
    rudderanalytics.page();
```
