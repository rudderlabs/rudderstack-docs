# DCM Floodlight

The [DCM Floodlight]() is the conversion tracking system for Google Marketing Platform. Like other conversion tracking systems, it consists of tags that track the activity on your site, along with reporting features for adding conversion data to your reports. It uses a cookie to recognize repeat visits from a specific browser.

Find the open-source transformer code for this destination in our <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/v0/destinations/dcm_floodlight">GitHub repo</a>.
</div>


## Getting Started

Before configuring DCM Floodlight as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by DCM Floodlight by referring to the table below: ̦

| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Device mode** | - | - | - |
| **Cloud mode** | **Supported**  | - | - |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between Cloud mode and Device mode in RudderStack, refer to the [**RudderStack connection modes**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/) guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to DCM Floodlight, follow these steps:

- From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **DCM Floodlight**.

<div class="infoBlock">

Follow our guide on [**How to Add a Source and Destination in RudderStack**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/) for more information.

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-destinations/dcm-floodlight-connection-settings2.png" alt="DCM Floodlight connection settings"/>

- **DoubleClick Advertiser ID:** Enter your Floodlight advertiser ID by going to the Campaigns or Activities tab in your dashboard.
- **Activity Tag:** Use this setting to define the same parameter value across all the conversion events. Alternatively, you can define this value for each conversion event mapping in the Floodlight Activity Tag field below.
- **Group Tag:** Use this setting to define the same parameter value across all the group conversion events. Alternatively, you can define this value for each conversion event in the Floodlight Group Tag field below.
- **RudderStack Event Name:** This integration lets you map the RudderStack event name to the Floodlight tags.
- **Floodlight Activity Tag:** This should be the `cat` of your tag string. If left blank, RudderStack will pick the value defined in the Activity Tag field above.
- **Floodlight Group Tag:** This should be the `type` of your tag string. If left blank, RudderStack will pick the value defined in the Group Tag field above.
- **Fire as Sales Tag:** Enable this toggle if the tag is a Sales tag. Keep it disabled if the tag is a Counter tag.
- **Custom Floodlight variables:** Use this section to map the RudderStack event properties to custom Floodlight variables.

## Identify

<div class="warningBlock">

The Snap Pixel will not be initialized unless the `identify` call is fired.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStacks checks the cookies for the user parameter \(email or phone number\) before loading the Snap Pixel snippet. If found, the snippet is loaded. Otherwise, an `identify` call with the user's email or phone number is required to load the snippet.
</div>

In Snap Pixel, the `identify` call initializes the Snap Pixel code.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the `identify` call, check out the [**RudderStack API spec**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/identify/).
</div>

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
    rudderanalytics.identify({
        email: "sample@sample.com",
        phone: "8787857564"
    });
```

Either or both of the user parameters should be passed in the `identify` call. The following table lists the parameters along with the relative mapping to the Snap Pixel parameters:

| **RudderStack User Parameter** | **Snap Pixel User Parameter** |
| :--- | :--- |
| `email` | `user_email` |
| `phone` | `user_phone_number` |



## Track

The `track` call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the `track` call, check out the [**RudderStack API spec**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/track/).
</div>

A sample `track` call is as shown below:

```javascript
    rudderanalytics.track('PURCHASE', {
        'currency': 'USD',
        'price': 333.33,
        'transaction_id': '11111111'
    });
```

You can also send the following RudderStack E-Commerce Events:

| **RudderStack Event Name** | **Snap Pixel Standard Event** |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Order Completed` | `PURCHASE` |
| `Checkout Started` | `START_CHECKOUT` |

</div>

## Group

The group call lets you link an identified user with a group, such as a company, organization, or an account. It also lets you record any custom traits associated with that group, such as the name of the company, the number of employees, etc.

A sample `group` call is as shown:

```javascript
    rudderanalytics.page();
```
