# DCM Floodlight

**DCM Floodlight** is a conversion tracking system for [Google Marketing Platform](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/). It lets you track the users' activity on your site, compiles their list, adds conversion data to your reports, and then targets those users by subsequent campaigns.

## Getting started

Before configuring DCM Floodlight as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by DCM Floodlight by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Device mode** | - | - | - |
| **Cloud mode** | **Supported**  | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">
    
To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</a> guide.

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to DCM Floodlight, follow these steps:

- From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **DCM Floodlight**.

- **DoubleClick Advertiser ID:** Enter your Advertiser ID visible in the **Campaigns** or **Activities** tab in your dashboard.

<div class="infoBlock">
    
Refer to the <a href="faq">FAQ</a> section to know more on how to obtain the Advertiser ID.
</div>

- **Activity Tag:** Enter the Floodlight Activity Tag (`cat`) to define the same parameter value across all the conversion events. Alternatively, you can define this value for each conversion event mapping in the **Floodlight Activity Tag** field below.
- **Group Tag:** Enter the Floodlight Group Tag (`type`) to define the same parameter value across all the group conversion events. Alternatively, you can define this value for each conversion event in the **Floodlight Group Tag** field below.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on finding <code class="inline-code">cat</code> and <code class="inline-code">type</code> in your Campaign Manager dashboard, refer to the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section below.
</div>

- **RudderStack Event Name:** Enter your RudderStack event name which will be mapped to the Floodlight tag.
- **Floodlight Activity Tag:** Enter the `cat` of your tag string. If left blank, RudderStack will pick the value from the **Activity Tag** field mentioned above.
- **Floodlight Group Tag:** Enter the `type` of your tag string. If left blank, RudderStack will pick the value from the **Group Tag** field mentioned above.
- **Fire as Sales Tag:** Enable the toggle button for Sales tag. Keep it disabled if it is a Counter tag.
 
<div class="infoBlock">

There are two types of tags:
    <ul>
    <li> <strong>Counter tag</strong>: Used to count the number of conversions. It is supposed to be placed on the confirmation page after a sale with information about the `ord` property passed to the tag. </li> 
    <li><strong>Sales tag</strong>: Used to count the number of conversions, the total number of sales that take place, and the total associated revenue. It is supposed to be placed on the confirmation page after a sale with information about the sales, like `cost`, `qty`, or `ord` properties passed to the tag.</li> 
        </ul>
</div>

- **Custom Floodlight variables:** Enter the custom Floodlight variables to capture additional reporting data beyond the usual metrics (like visits and revenue).

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on finding the custom Floodlight variables, refer to the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section below.

## Track

The [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/track/) call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.

A sample `track` call is as shown below:

```javascript
client.track({
  userId: "1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm",
  event: "Checkout Started",
  properties: {
    orderId: 1234,
    quantity: 45,
    revenue: 800,
  },
  context: {
    device: {
      advertisingId: "2a3e36d172-5e28-45a1-9eda-ce22a3e36d1a",
    },
    userAgent: "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_2) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/79.0.3945.88 Safari/537.36",
  },
  integrations: {
    All: true,
    "DCM Floodlight": {
      COPPA: "false",
      GDPR: "1",
      npa: "true",
    },
  },
});
```

<div class="warningBlock">

<code class="inline-code">userAgent</code> is a required field and must be passed. Otherwise, you will get an error.
</div>
