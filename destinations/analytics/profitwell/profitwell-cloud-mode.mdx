# Cloud Mode

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on sending events via the RudderStack Cloud mode, refer to the [**RudderStack Connection Modes**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/) guide.
</div>

<div class="successBlock">

**Find the open-source transformer code for this destination in our** [**GitHub repo**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/v0/destinations/profitwell).
</div>

## Getting Started

To enable sending data to ProfitWell, you will first need to add it as a destination in RudderStack. Once the destination is enabled, events from our SDKs will automatically start flowing to ProfitWell.

Before configuring ProfitWell as a destination in RudderStack, make sure that the source platform is supported by ProfitWell by referring to the following table:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Device mode** | **Supported** | - | - |
| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to ProfitWell, follow the steps below:

* From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **ProfitWell**.

<div class="infoBlock">

Follow our guide on [**Adding a Source and Destination in RudderStack**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/) for more information.
</div>

* Assign a name to the destination, and click on **Next**. You will then see the following **Connection Settings** window:

### Connection Settings

To successfully configure ProfitWell as a Cloud Mode destination, enter the following connection settings:

* **Private API Key**: Enter your ProfitWell private API key here. To obtain the **Private API Key**, log into your ProfitWell account. Then, navigate to the **Account Settings** - **Integration** option. Here, you can get your API key under [**API Keys/Dev Kit**](https://www2.profitwell.com/app/account/integrations), as shown in the following image:

<div class="infoBlock">

To send events to ProfitWell via the Cloud Mode, you don't need to enter the **Public API Key**.
</div>

* Finally, click on **Next** to complete the setup. ProfitWell should now be configured and enabled as a destination in RudderStack.

## Identify

The `identify` call lets you create or update a subscription for a particular user.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the `identify` call, refer to the [**RudderStack Events Specification**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/identify/) guide.
</div>

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify(
  "user0001",
  {
    planId: "Starter",
    email: "axel@testmail.com",
    planInterval: "month",
    effectiveDate: 1630645519,
    planCurrency: "USD",
    subscriptionAlias: "starter_axel",
    value: "2000",
    name: "Axel Rose",
    age: 25,
    phone: "+911234665544",
  },
  {
    externalId: [
      { type: "profitwellSubscriptionId", id: "pws_psqfbi9zODBB" },
      { type: "profitwellUserId", id: "pws_MS2g4ON214dU" },
    ],
  }
);
```

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack passes the fields `profitwellUserId` and `profitwellSubscriptionId` as `externalId`.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">
Note that:
<ul>
    <li>The <code class="inline-code">externalId</code> of type <code class="inline-code">profitwellUserId</code> is mapped to ProfitWell's <code class="inline-code">user_id</code> field. </li>
    <li>The <code class="inline-code">externalId</code> of type <code class="inline-code">profitwellSubscriptionId</code> is mapped to ProfitWell's <code class="inline-code">subscription_id</code> field. </li>
</ul>
</div>

### Identify Mapping

This section lists the various criteria for mapping RudderStack fields to ProfitWell fields.

The following table lists all the supported fields for **`Creating Subscriptions`** with their relative mapping to the ProfitWell fields:

| **RudderStack Field** | **ProfitWell Field** |
| :--- | :--- |
| `userId` | `user_alias` |
| `subscriptionAlias` | `subscription_alias` |
| `email` | `email` |
| `planId` | `plan_id` |
| `planInterval` | `plan_interval` |
| `planCurrency` | `plan_currency` |
| `status` | `status` |
| `value` | `value` |
| `effectiveDate` | `effective_date` |

The following table lists all the supported fields for **`Updating Subscriptions`** with their relative mapping to the ProfitWell fields:

| **RudderStack Field** | **ProfitWell Field** |
| :--- | :--- |
| `planId` | `plan_id` |
| `planInterval` | `plan_interval` |
| `value` | `value` |
| `status` | `status` |
| `effectiveDate` | `effective_date` |

<div class="infoBlock">

While creating a subscription, if `effectiveDate` is not provided in the `identify` call, then RudderStack takes the date from the event call's `originalTimestamp`.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on using these fields, refer to the [**ProfitWell documentation**](https://profitwellapiv2.docs.apiary.io/#).
</div>

RudderStack discards the `identify` event in the following two scenarios:

* For a given `profitwellUserId`, a user account is not found in ProfitWell.
* For a given `profitWellUserId`, a `profitwellSubscriptionId` is not found.

<div class="infoBlock">

If you provide a `userId`\(mapped to `user_alias` in ProfitWell\) or a `subscriptionAlias` \(mapped to `subscription_alias`\) in the `identify` call, a new user subscription is created if it is not already present.
</div>
