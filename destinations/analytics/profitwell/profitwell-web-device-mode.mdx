# Device Mode

RudderStack lets you send your event data to ProfitWell via the Web Device mode, i.e. using the native web SDK.

For more information on sending events via the Device mode, refer to the [**RudderStack connection modes**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/) guide.

<div class="successBlock">

**Find the open-source JavaScript SDK code for this destination in our** [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-js/tree/production/integrations/ProfitWell).
</div>

## Getting Started

To enable sending data to ProfitWell, you will first need to add it as a destination in RudderStack. Once the destination is enabled, events from our SDKs will automatically start flowing to ProfitWell.

Before configuring ProfitWell as a destination in RudderStack, make sure that the source platform is supported by ProfitWell by referring to the following table:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Device mode** | **Supported** | - | - |
| **Cloud mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to ProfitWell, follow the steps below:

* From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **ProfitWell**.

<div class="infoBlock">

Follow our guide on [**Adding a Source and Destination in RudderStack**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/) for more information.
</div>

* Assign a name to the destination, and click on **Next**. You will then see the following **Connection Settings** window:

### Connection Settings

To successfully configure ProfitWell as a Device Mode destination, enter the following connection settings:

* **Public API Key**: Enter your ProfitWell public API key here. To obtain the **Public API Key**, log into your ProfitWell account. Then, navigate to the **Account Settings** - **Integration** option. Here, you can get your API key under [**API Keys/Dev Kit**](https://www2.profitwell.com/app/account/integrations), as shown in the following image:

<div class="infoBlock">

The **Private API Key** field is **not** required if you want to send the events via the Device Mode.
</div>

* **Site Type**: Choose the site type from the dropdown. If the site type is **Web App**, then RudderStack will start the ProfitWell service either with `email` or `userId`. For the type **Marketing**, RudderStack will start the ProfitWell service anonymously.
* **Use device-mode to send events**: Enable this option to send events via the **Device mode**.

<div class="warningBlock">

The **Private API Key** field is **not** required if you want to send the events via the Device Mode.
</div>

* Finally, click on **Next** to complete the setup. ProfitWell should now be configured and enabled as a destination in RudderStack.

## Identify

For the **Web App** site type, the `identify` call will start the ProfitWell Service using the customer's `email`. If no email is provided, then RudderStack will start the service with the user's `userId`. For the **Marketing** type, RudderStack will start the ProfitWell service anonymously.

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
  rudderanalytics.identify( "userId", {email: "sample@domain.com"});
```

For the `identify` call to trigger user engagements, you need to first create [**Customers**](https://www2.profitwell.com/app/customers) within ProfitWell.
