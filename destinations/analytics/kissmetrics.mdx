# Kissmetrics

[Kissmetrics](https://www.kissmetrics.io/) is a product analytics platform to help you increase conversion, as well as drive customer engagement and retention.

RudderStack supports sending your events from cloud mode S2S \(Server to Server\) and Web Native SDKs by calling our APIs.

<div class="successBlock">

Find the open-source transformer code for this destination in our <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/v0/destinations/kissmetrics">GitHub repo</a>.
</div>

## Getting Started

To enable sending data to Kissmetrics, you will first need to add it as a destination to the source from which you are sending event data. Once the destination is enabled, events from our SDKs will start to flow to Kissmetrics.

Before configuring Kissmetrics as a destination in RudderStack, please make sure that the source platform is supported by Kissmetrics. You can refer to the following table to do so:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | **Supported** | -             | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between Cloud mode and Device mode in RudderStack, read the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack connection modes</a> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that Kissmetrics supports the source type, perform the steps below:

- From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderlabs.com/), add the source and select **Kissmetrics** as a destination.

<div class="infoBlock">

Please follow our guide on <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/">How to Add a Source and Destination in RudderStack</a> to add a source and destination in RudderStack.

</div>

- Give a name to your destination, and then click on **Next**. You should see the following screen:

<img src="../../assets/image (24) (1) (1).png" /><span class="imageTitle">Connection Settings for Kissmetrics in RudderStack</span>

- Please enter the **API Key** in the **Connection Settings**. You may also enable the **Use native SDK to send events** setting to send events through Kissmetrics' native JavaScript SDK.

### Prefix Properties

Enabling this setting will add the event name to all the properties of the event. This works for `page` **and** `track` properties.

<div class="infoBlock">

You will need to enable this setting while building reports in Kissmetrics.
</div>

- Once you have finalized the settings, click on **Next** to complete the configuration and add Kissmetrics as a destination in RudderStack.

## Identify

Calling `rudderanalytics.identify()` pushes an `identify` call with the `userId` and `set` with the `user-traits` to the Kissmetrics queue object while using the the Native SDK. For more information on the `identify` call, please refer to our [RudderStack API Specification](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/) documentation.

For sending data through the API's cloud mode, we call the `http://trk.kissmetrics.com/s` end-point for registering users and their traits.

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
// a sample identify
rudderanalytics.identify("my-userID", {
  name: "Tintin",
  city: "Brussels",
  country: "Belgium",
  email: "tintin@herge.com"
});
```

will pass the following to the `_kmq kissmetrics` object.

```javascript
['identify', 'my-userID']
['set',
  {
    name: "Tintin",
    city: "Brussels",
    country: "Belgium",
    email: "tintin@herge.com"
  }
]
```

<div class="infoBlock">

Nested objects are flattened as <code class="inline-code">a.b.c</code> for input data <code class="inline-code">&#123;a:&#123;b:c&#125;&#125;</code> before sending the data to Kissmetrics, as it is unable to parse nested objects.
</div>

## Page

Calling `rudderanalytics.page()` will record the page properties for event `Viewed <category> <name> page`. For more information on the `page` call, please refer to our [RudderStack API Specification](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/) documentation.

A sample page event is as shown:

```javascript
// "home" is the name of the page.
rudderanalytics.page("home", {
  path: "path",
  url: "url",
  title: "title",
  search: "search",
  referrer: "referrer"
});
```

The above snippet will pass the following to the `_kmq kissmetrics` object:

```javascript
['record', 'Viewed home page',  {
  path: "path",
  url: "url",
  title: "title",
  search: "search",
  referrer: "referrer"
}]
```

<div class="infoBlock">

 Automatically-tracked Kissmetrics events such as <strong>Visited a site</strong>, etc. will function as and when integrated with RudderStack. Stay tuned!
</div>

## Track

Calling `rudderanalytics.track()` pushes a record with the event name and the associated properties \_\_when using the native SDK integration. For more information on the `track` call, please refer to our [RudderStack API Specification](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/) documentation.

For sending data through the API's cloud mode, we call the [http://trk.kissmetrics.com/e](http://trk.kissmetrics.com/e) end-point for registering the event and its associated properties.

A sample `track` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Track me", {
  category: "category",
  label: "label",
  value: "value",
});
```

will pass the following to the `_kmq kissmetrics` object.

```javascript
['record', "Track me", {
  category: "category",
  label: "label",
  value: "value"
}]
```

An event sent to RudderStack with a property called `revenue` , is passed on to Kissmetrics as `Billing amount` as well as `revenue`.

<div class="infoBlock">

In order to send E-commerce events that have a product array as one of their <code class="inline-code">track</code> properties, RudderStack sends each product property to the <code class="inline-code">/s</code> endpoint from the cloud mode, or pushes it as <code class="inline-code">['set', &#123;id:, sku: ...&#125;]</code> from the native SDK.
</div>

## Alias

Calling `rudderanalytics.alias()` passes an `alias`call with `userId` and `previousId` to the Kissmetrics queue, when used as a Native SDK integration.

While passing data using the cloud mode, we call the [http://trk.kissmetrics.com/a](http://trk.kissmetrics.com/a) endpoint to alias user identities.

The following code snippet shows a sample `alias` call in RudderStack:

```javascript
// assuming the previous set userId was "my-userID"
rudderanalytics.alias("my-new-userID");
```

will pass the following to the `_kmq kissmetrics` object.

```javascript
['alias', "my-new-userID", "userId"]
```

## Screen

The `screen` call records the screen views of the user in your App. If you have turned on the screen views in your App implementation from the [iOS](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-ios-sdk/) or [Android](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-android-sdk/) SDK it will register in your dashboard. We'll forward the `properties` you've passed along with the `screen` call as it is.

Here is a sample `screen` call in using RudderStack iOS SDK:

```javascript
[[RudderClient sharedInstance] screen:@"Main"
            properties:@{@"prop_key" : @"prop_value"}];
```
