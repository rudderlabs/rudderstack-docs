## FAQs

### Can I anonymize an IP Address in Google Analytics 360?

Yes, you can. Turn on the **Anonymize IP Addresses** setting under the **Other Settings** option in the RudderStack dashboard while configuring Google Analytics 360.

This setting lets Google Analytics anonymize the address at the earliest possible stage of the data collection.
