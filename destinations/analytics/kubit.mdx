# Kubit

[Kubit](https://www.kubit.ai/) is a self-service product analytics platform with no-code integration that facilitates efficient data discovery. With Kubit, you can better understand your users' behavior and use the insights to drive customer retention and your product growth.

<div class="successBlock">

Kubit can also consume data from your cloud data warehouse directly, so you don't have to configure it as a destination in RudderStack separately.

For more information, check out their <a href="https://www.kubit.ai/doc">docs</a>.

## Supported Calls

Kubit currently supports only `identify` and `track` calls.

### Identify

The `identify` call lets you capture the actions of a visiting user. It also lets you record any traits associated with them such as their name, email address, etc.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the <code class="inline-code">identify</code> call, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/http-api/">HTTP API Specification</a> guide.

</div>

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("userId", {
  name: "Name",
  email: "name@xyz.com",
})
```

### Track

The `track` call allows you to capture any user action along with the properties associated with that action.

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the <code class="inline-code">track</code> call, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/http-api/">HTTP API Specification</a> guide.

</div>

A sample `track` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Order Completed", {
  orderId: "1234567",
  price: "567",
  currency: "USD",
})
```
