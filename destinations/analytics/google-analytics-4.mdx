# Google Analytics 4

[Google Analytics 4](https://analytics.google.com/) \(formerly known as "App + Web"\) is a new Google Analytics property, with different instrumentation and reports than the Universal Analytics properties. Google Analytics 4 can be used for websites, apps, or both together - whereas Universal Analytics properties only support websites.

RudderStack supports the `gtag` way of tagging in websites.

## Getting Started

To enable sending data to **Google Analytics 4**, you will first need to add it as a destination to the source from which you are sending your event data. Once the destination is enabled, events from RudderStack will start flowing to Google Analytics 4.

Before configuring your source and destination on the RudderStack, please verify if the source platform is supported by Google Analytics 4, by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | Web           | Mobile | Server |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :----- | :----- |
| **Device Mode**     | **Supported** | **-**  | **-**  |
| **Cloud Mode**      | **-**         | **-**  | **-**  |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between Cloud mode and Device mode in RudderStack, read the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack connection modes</a> guide.

</div>

Once you have confirmed that the platform supports sending events to Google Analytics 4, please perform the steps below:

- Choose a source to which you would like to add Google Analytics 4 as a destination.

<div class="infoBlock">

Please follow our <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/">Adding a Source and Destination</a> guide to add a source in RudderStack.

</div>

- Select the destination as **Google Analytics 4** to your source. Give your destination a name and then click on **Next**.
- On the **Connection Settings** page, fill all the fields with the relevant information and click **Next**.

- In the **Connection Settings**, please enter your **Measurement Id** as shown above.

## Identify

User-ID is an advanced feature that lets GA4 present a cross-device, cross-platform view of your customers' behavior. Google Analytics 4 uses `userId` and `deviceId` \(GA's `cid` value from Universal Analytics terminology\) to identify users.

Google Analytics 4 also allows you to set a user ID to the identified visitors if **Send User ID to GA** is enabled in the destination settings page in the RudderStack app. RudderStack will send the identified `userId` according to [this guide](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/cookies-user-id#set_user_id).

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("sample_user_id", {
  name: "Test name",
  email: "test@emai.com",
})
```

In the above snippet, the `userId` will be set to `sample_user_id` for Google Analytics and the name and email will be set as `user_properties`.

If **Send User ID to GA** is disabled then we do not set `userId` . Instead, we only send user traits to be set as `user_properties` in Google Analytics. The user properties are set on the `gtag` client according to [this](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/user-properties) guide.

## Page

Google Analytics 4 `gtag` sends a `page_view` event to Google Analytics by default every-time it is loaded. You can also send `page_view` event to google analytics whenever you make an explicit `page()` call to RudderStack SDK.

We send following properties by default:

- `path` mapped to `page_location`
- `title` mapped to `page_title`
- `referrer` mapped to `page_referrer`

You can also make `page()` call with any custom and standard properties as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page({
  path: "/test_browser.html",
  url: "http://example.com/test_browser.html?param1=true",
  title: "Page Load",
  search: "?param1=true",
  referrer: "referrer",
})
```

### Extend Page View Property

Google Analytics 4 has a limit on the number of unique properties per event name. The default `page_view` event supports the above properties as mentioned [in this guide](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9234069?hl=en&ref_topic=6317484). If the **Extend Page View Property** config is enabled, then RudderStack sends the following properties along with any other custom property passed to `page` call of the RudderStack SDK:

- `url`
- `search`

### Block Page View Event

When this config is enabled we disable sending Google Analytics 4 `page_view` events on load, instead you can explicitly send a `page_view` event by calling Rudder SDK **page\(\)** API.

## Track

The `track` call allows you to capture any action that the user might perform, along with the properties that are associated with that action. Each action is considered to be an event.

A sample `track` call looks like the following:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Track me")
```

RudderStack's SDK will send the track event name and any properties as custom properties to Google Analytics 4.

<div class="infoBlock">

For properties that are nested and not a standard Google Analytics 4 property, RudderStack SDK will flatten them before sending to Google Analytics.

<div class="infoBlock">

There are limits on the number of custom properties per event that can be sent to Google Analytics 4. RudderStack SDK <code class="inline-code">doesn't drop</code> the payload based on these limits. If the events are not showing up in **debug view or reports on Google Analytics dashboard**, please refer <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9237506?hl=en">this</a> for collection limits.

## eCommerce

RudderStack supports eCommerce tracking for Google Analytics 4. Use the [RudderStack eCommerce spec](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api-spec/rudderstack-ecommerce-events-specification) for sending events while instrumenting your site with the RudderStack SDK.

Below are some examples of the track event names that are passed to Google Analytics 4-specific eCommerce event name:

| RudderStack event name    | Google Analytics 4 event name |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------- |
| Products Searched         | `search`                      |
| Product List Viewed       | `view_item_list`              |
| Promotion Viewed          | `view_promotion`              |
| Product Clicked           | `select_item`                 |
| Product Added To Wishlist | `add_to_wishlist`             |
| Product Added             | `add_to_cart`                 |
| Cart Shared               | `share`                       |
| Checkout Started          | `begin_checkout`              |
| Order Completed           | `purchase`                    |

<div class="infoBlock">

For each product in the order, there must be an <code class="inline-code">id</code> and <code class="inline-code">name</code> associated. More info on Google Analytics 4 e-commerce event and corresponding properties can be found <a href="https://developers.google.com/gtagjs/reference/ga4-events#view_item_list">here</a>.
