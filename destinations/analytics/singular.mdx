# Singular

[Singular](https://www.singular.net/) is a marketing intelligence platform to transform your marketing data into accurate, granular, and actionable insights that drive growth.

RudderStack supports Singular as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your event data.

## Getting started

Before configuring Singular as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Singular, by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server** |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :--------- |
| **Device mode**     | -             | **Supported** | -          |
| **Cloud mode**      | -             | -             | -          |

<div class="infoBlock">

This destination supports sending events via only the Android and iOS device modes.

<span>

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://maven.singular.net/' }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.1.2'
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:1.6.10"
    }
}
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://maven.singular.net/' }
    }

<span>

```kotlin
// initializing Rudder SDK
val rudderClient = RudderClient.getInstance(
  this,
  WRITE_KEY,
  RudderConfig.Builder()
          .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)
          .withFactory(SingularIntegrationFactory.FACTORY)
          .build()
  )
```
</span>
</li>

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information, refer to the <a href="https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360037581952-Android-SDK-Basic-Integration?navigation_side_bar=true"  target="_blank">Singular Android documentation</a>.
</div>
</ul>
      </TabPanel>
    </TabPanels>
</Tabs>

## Implementing SKAdNetwork (SKAN) support

To give Singular the control to your SKAdNetwork integration, add the following code before the initialization of the iOS SDK:

```objectivec
[RudderSingularIntegration setSKANOptions:YES
        isManualSkanConversionManagementMode:YES
withWaitForTrackingAuthorizationWithTimeoutInterval:@0
        withConversionValueUpdatedHandler:^(NSInteger conversionValue){
    // Receive a callback whenever the Conversion Value is updated
    NSLog(@"SKAN handler %ld",conversionValue);
}];
```

<div class="infoBlock">

For more details, refer to the <a href="https://support.singular.net/hc/en-us/articles/360047454611" target="_blank">iOS SDK: Adding SKAdNetwork Support</a> section of the Singular documentation.
</div>

## Identify

For device mode destinations, the Singular SDK uses the `identify` method to map the RudderStack user ID to their custom user ID.

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```kotlin
RudderClient.getInstance()?.identify("User123")
```

## Track

The `track` call lets you capture any user actions and the properties associated with them. Each user action is considered to be an event.

### Tracking custom events

A custom `track` call lets you track custom events as they occur in your apps. RudderStack sends these calls to Singular where they are processed as custom post-install events and are made available in the relevant reports.

A sample custom `track` call is shown in the following snippet:

```kotlin
RudderClient.getInstance()?.track("Order Completed",
    RudderProperty()
        .putValue("affiliation", "affiliation_1")
        .putValue("delivery", "123")
        .putValue("taxation", "456")
        .putValue("order_id", "789")
)
```

### Tracking revenue

Singular supports tracking revenue events. It receives revenue tracking whenever an event containing the `revenue` property is sent(including a zero value). Optionally, you can also pass the `currency` field as an ISO3 code. 

<div class="infoBlock">

The default currency is set to <code class="inline-code">USD</code>.
</div>

A sample `revenue` track call is shown below:

```kotlin
RudderClient.getInstance()?.track("Order Completed",
    RudderProperty()
        .putValue("revenue", 1251)
        .putValue("currency", "INR")
)
```

## Screen

The `screen` method allows you to record whenever a user sees the mobile screen, along with any associated optional properties. This call is similar to the `page` call, but exclusive to your mobile device.

A sample `screen` call looks like the following code snippet:

```kotlin
RudderClient.getInstance()?.screen("Sample Screen Name",
            RudderProperty()
                .putValue("prop_key","prop_value"));
```

In the above snippet, RudderStack captures all the information related to the viewed screen, along with any additional info associated with that event.

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack sends the <code class="inline-code">screen</code> to Singular as a custom event.
</div>

## Reset

The `reset` method calls will release the identity of the current user and create a new anonymous session. It should be called when the users log out.

A sample `reset` call for both the Android and iOS SDKs is shown below:

<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>iOS</Tab>
    <Tab>Android</Tab>
  </TabList>
    <TabPanels>
      <TabPanel>
<span>

```objectivec
[[RSClient getInstance] reset];
```
</span>
      </TabPanel>
      <TabPanel>
<span>

```kotlin
RudderClient.getInstance()?.reset();
```
</span>
      </TabPanel>
    </TabPanels>
</Tabs>
