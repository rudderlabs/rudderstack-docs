# Lytics

[Lytics](https://www.lytics.com/) is a popular customer data platform built for marketers. It allows you to efficiently leverage your first-party customer data to deliver tailored customer journeys.

RudderStack supports Lytics as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your event data.

</div>

## Getting started

Before configuring Lytics as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Lytics, by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | **Supported** | -             | **-**         |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</a> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Lytics, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Lytics**.

<div class="infoBlock">

</div>

2. Assign a name to your destination and click on **Next**.

### Connection settings

</div>

- **Stream Name**: Enter the name of the Lytics stream where you want to send the events.
- **Client-side Event Filtering**: This setting is applicable **only if** you are sending events to Lytics via the device mode. 

<div class="infoBlock">

</div>

If you are using the native web SDK to send the events to Lytics, enter the following settings:

- **Allow UID Sharing Across Multiple Domains**: When enabled, this option lets you identify users across domains.
- **Ensure Entity**: When this option is enabled, RudderStack gets your most updated audience membership and profile data, before sending it to Lytics.

## Identify

The `identify` call captures the relevant details about the visiting user.
