# Setting up Google Analytics 4 in RudderStack

To enable sending data to Google Analytics 4, first add it as a destination in RudderStack. Once the destination is configured and enabled, events from RudderStack will start flowing to Google Analytics 4.

Before configuring Google Analytics 4 as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Google Analytics 4, by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | Web           | Mobile | Server |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :----- | :----- |
| **Device Mode**     | **Supported** | **-**  | **-**  |
| **Cloud Mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported**  | **Supported**  |

To know more about the difference between Cloud mode and Device mode in RudderStack, read the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack connection modes</a> guide.

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Google Analytics 4, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Google Analytics 4**.
2. Assign a name to your destination and click on Next.

### Client-side events filtering

<div class="infoBlock">

This option is applicable only if you're sending events to Google Analytics 4 via the web device mode. Refer to the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/event-filtering/">Client-side Event Filtering</a> guide for more information on this feature.
</div>

### Web SDK settings

- **Use device mode to send events**: Enable this setting to send events via the [RudderStack device mode](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode).
- **Block a Page View Event**: Enable this setting to disable sending `page_view` events on load. However, you can explicitly send a `page_view` event by calling the `page()` API.
- **Extend Page View Property**: Enable this setting to send the following properties along with any other custom property passed to the `page` call of the RudderStack SDK:
  - `url`
  - `search`
 
<div class="infoBlock">
  
Google Analytics 4 has a limit on the number of unique properties per event name. The default `page_view` event supports the properties mentioned in <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9234069?hl=en&ref_topic=6317484">Automatically collected events</a>() guide.
  </div>
  
- **Send userId to GA**: Enabling or disabling this setting exhibits the following behavior:
  - If enabled, user ID is set to the identified visitors and sent according to [Cookies and user identification](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/devguides/cookies#set_user_id) document.
  - If disabled, userId is not sent. Instead, Rudderstack only sends user traits set as `user_properties` to Google Analytics. The user properties are set on the `gtag` client according to [Set user properties](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/user-properties?technology=websites) guide.


Finally, click on Next. Google Analytics 4 is now enabled as a destination in Rudderstack.
