# Setting up Google Analytics 4

Before configuring Google Analytics 4 as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Google Analytics 4 by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**           | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :----- | :----- |
| **Device Mode**     | **Supported** | **-**  | **-**  |
| **Cloud Mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported**  | **Supported**  |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between Cloud mode and Device mode in RudderStack, read the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack connection modes</a> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Google Analytics 4, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Google Analytics 4**.
2. Assign a name to your destination and click on Next.

## Connection settings

To successfully configure Google Analytics 4 as a destination, configure the following settings:

<img src="/assets/event-stream-destinations/google-analytics-4-connection-settings.png" alt="Google Analytics 4 Connection Settings in RudderStack"/>

- **API Secret**: This field is required only for the cloud mode setup where you can enter the API Secret generated through the Google Analytics dashboard. It can be created in the Google Analytics dashboard under **Admin > Data Streams > choose your stream > Measurement Protocol > Create**.
  
- **Measurement Id**: Enter the Measurement Id which is the identifier for a data stream. It can be found in Google Analytics dashboard under **Admin > Data Streams > choose your stream > Measurement ID**.

<div class="infoBlock">
  
 Refer to the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> section for more information on how to obtain the API Secret and Measurement Id.
  </div>

- **Firebase App Id**: Enter the Firebase App ID which is the identifier for Firebase app. It can be found in Firebase dashboard under **Project Settings > General**.

<div class="infoBlock">
  
 If you are using the <code class="inline-code">gtag</code>, <strong>API Secret</strong> and <strong>Measurement Id</strong> are the required fields. However, if you are using the Firebase app, <strong>Firebase App Id</strong> and <strong>API Secret</strong> are the required fields.
  </div>
  
  - **Block a Page View Event**: Enable this setting to disable sending `page_view` events on load. However, you can explicitly send a `page_view` event by calling the `page()` API.
- **Extend Page View Property**: Enable this setting to send the following properties along with any other custom property passed to the `page` call of the RudderStack SDK:
  - `url`
  - `search`
 
<div class="infoBlock">
  
Google Analytics 4 has a limit on the number of unique properties per event name. The default `page_view` event supports the properties mentioned in <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9234069?hl=en&ref_topic=6317484">Automatically collected events</a> guide.
  </div>
  
- **Send userId to GA**: Enabling or disabling this setting exhibits the following behavior:
  - If enabled, user ID is set to the identified visitors and sent according to [Cookies and user identification](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/devguides/cookies#set_user_id) document.
  - If disabled, userId is not sent. Instead, Rudderstack only sends user traits set as `user_properties` to Google Analytics. The user properties are set on the `gtag` client according to [Set user properties](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/user-properties?technology=websites) guide.

### Client-side events filtering

Refer to the <a href="https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/event-filtering/">Client-side Event Filtering</a> guide for more information on this feature.

### Web SDK settings

Finally, click on Next. Google Analytics 4 is now enabled as a destination in Rudderstack.
