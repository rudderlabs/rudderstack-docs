## Track

The [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/track/) call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.

A sample `track` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track('product list viewed', {
  list_id: "related_products",
  category: "Related_products",
  products: [{
    product_id: "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
    name: "Monopoly: 3rd Edition",
    coupon: "SUMMER_FUN",
    category: "Apparel",
    brand: "Google",
    variant: "green",
    price: "19",
    quantity: "2",
    position: "1",
    affiliation: "Google Merchandise Store",
    currency: "USD",
    discount: 2.22,
    item_category2: "Adult",
    item_category3: "Shirts",
    item_category4: "Crew",
    item_category5: "Short sleeve",
    item_list_id: "related_products",
    item_list_name: "Related Products",
    location_id: "L_12345"
  }]
});
```

## E-commerce

RudderStack supports e-commerce tracking for Google Analytics 4. Use the [RudderStack eCommerce spec](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-ecommerce-events-specification/) for sending events while instrumenting your site with the RudderStack SDK.

Below are some examples of the track event names that are passed to Google Analytics 4-specific e-commerce event name:

| RudderStack event name    | Google Analytics 4 event name |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------- |
| Products Searched         | `search`                      |
| Product List Viewed       | `view_item_list`              |
| Promotion Viewed          | `view_promotion`              |
| Product Clicked           | `select_item`                 |
| Product Added To Wishlist | `add_to_wishlist`             |
| Product Added             | `add_to_cart`                 |
| Cart Shared               | `share`                       |
| Checkout Started          | `begin_checkout`              |
| Order Completed           | `purchase`                    |
