# Google Optimize

[**Google Optimize**](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/optimize/) is Google's free website optimization tool that lets you run different website tests to tailor personalized user experiences and increase your conversion rate.

RudderStack supports Google Optimize as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your website data for efficient A/B testing.

## Getting started

Before configuring Google Optimize as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Google Optimize by referring to the table below:

| Connection Mode     | Web           | Mobile                 | Server        |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :--------------- | :-------------|
| **Device mode**     | **Supported**                        | -                      | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | -                   | -                           | - |
