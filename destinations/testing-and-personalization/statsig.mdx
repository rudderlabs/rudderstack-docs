# Statsig

Statsig helps companies safely A/B test features in production before rolling them out, avoiding product debates and costly mistakes when shipping out new features. Statsig automates the grunt work so that your A/B tests run automatically, and you always get the latest insights into how your product features are performing.

RudderStack supports Statsig as a destination to which you can send real-time event data for efficient A/B testing.

## Getting started

Before configuring Statsig as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Statsig by referring to the table below:

| Connection Mode     | Web           | Mobile                 | Server        |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :--------------------- | :-------------|
| **Device mode**     | -             | -                      | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported**          | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">
 
 To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack connection modes</a> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that your source platform supports sending events to Statsig, follow these steps:

* From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **Statsig**.

<div class="infoBlock">
 
 Follow our guide on <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/">Adding a Source and Destination in RudderStack</a> for more information.
</div>

* Assign a name to the destination and click on **Next**. You should then see the following screen:

## Identify

The `identify` call lets you identify a visiting user and associate them to their actions. It also lets you record the traits about them like their name, email address, etc.

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("userId", {
  name: "Name Surname",
  email: "name@domain.com",
})
```

<div class="infoBlock">
 
  For more information on the <code class="inline-code">identify</code> event, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/identify/">RudderStack Event Specification</a> guide.
</div>

## Page

The `page` call lets you record your website's page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page. Many destinations require the `page` events to be called at least once every page load.

A sample `page` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page("Home")
```

<div class="infoBlock">
 
  For more information on the <code class="inline-code">page</code> event, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/page/">RudderStack Event Specification</a> guide.
</div>

## Track

The `track` call lets you record the user events, i.e. the actions your users perform, along with any properties associated with these actions.

A sample `track` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Product Reviewed", {
  review_id: "12345",
  product_id: "123",
  rating: 3.0,
  review_body: "Average product, expected much more."
})
```

<div class="infoBlock">
 
  For more information on the <code class="inline-code">track</code> call, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/track/">RudderStack Event Specification</a> guide.
</div>

## Screen

The `screen` call lets you record whenever a user views their mobile screen, with any additional relevant information about the viewed screen.

A sample `screen` call sent via the [**RudderStack iOS SDK**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-ios-sdk/) is shown below:

```objectivec
[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@"Main"
                properties:@{@"prop_key" : @"prop_value"}];
```

<div class="infoBlock">
 
  For more information on the <code class="inline-code">screen</code> call, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/screen/">RudderStack Event Specification</a> guide.
</div>

## Group

The `group` call allows you to link an identified user with a group, such as a company, organization, or an account. It also lets you record any custom traits associated with that group, e.g. the name of the company, number of employees, etc.

A sample `group` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.group("12345", {
  name: "MyGroup",
  industry: "IT",
  employees: 450,
  plan: "basic"
})
```

<div class="infoBlock">
 
  For more information on the <code class="inline-code">group</code> call, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/group/">RudderStack Event Specification</a> guide.
</div>

## Alias

The `alias` call lets you merge different identities of a known user.

<div class="infoBlock">

<code class="inline-code">alias</code> is an advanced method that lets you change the tracked user's ID explicitly. This method is useful when managing identities for some of the downstream destinations.
</div>

A sample `alias` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.alias("12345")
```

<div class="infoBlock">
 
  For more information on the <code class="inline-code">alias</code> call, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/alias/">RudderStack Event Specification</a> guide.
