# Split.io

[Split.io](https://www.split.io/) is a feature experimentation and continuous delivery tool. It enables you to maximize the impact of your product features by combining feature flags and data. With Split.io, you can test new features through rigorous A/B testing and deploy them seamlessly while ensuring data privacy and maximum performance.

RudderStack supports Split.io as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your customer data.

</div>

## Getting started

Before configuring your source and destination on the RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Split.io by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | -             | -             | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, read the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack Connection Modes</a> guide.

Once you have confirmed that the source platform supports sending events to Split.io, follow these steps:

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add a source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Split.io**.
2. Assign a name to the destination and click on **Next**.

## Identify

The [`identify`](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/) call lets you uniquely identify a user and record any associated traits about them like their name, email, etc.

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm", {
  name: "Alex Keener",
  email: "alex@example.com",
  plan: "GOLD",
  age: 40,
})
```

</div>

## Track

A [`track`](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/) call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Clicked button", {
  color: "red",
  buttonText: "Get started",

```

The `eventTypeId` argument (**Clicked button** in the above example) in `track` call should meet the following requirements:
- It should start with a letter or number.
- It should contain 80 characters or less.
- It should contain only letters, numbers, hyphen, underscore, or period.

[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@"Main" properties:@{@"prop_key" : @"prop_value"}];
```

The above snippet captures information related to the viewed screen such as its name and category.
