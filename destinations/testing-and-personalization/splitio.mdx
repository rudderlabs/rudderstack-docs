# Split.io

[Split.io](https://www.split.io/) is a feature experimentation and continuous delivery tool. It enables you to maximize the impact of your product features by combining feature flags and data. With Split.io, you can test new features through rigorous A/B testing and deploy them seamlessly while ensuring data privacy and maximum performance.

RudderStack supports Split.io as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your customer data.

## Getting started

Before configuring your source and destination on the RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Split.io by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | -             | -             | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, read the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-cloud/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack connection modes</a> guide.

</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source supports sending events to Split.io, follow these steps:

<div class="successBlock">

  Keep the API Key of the particular workspace in your Split.io dashboard handy as it is used later to configure Split.io as a destination.

1. From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. Then, from the list of destinations, select **Split.io**.

2. Assign a name to your destination and click on **Next**.

## Identify

The [`identify`](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/) call lets you uniquely identify a user and record any associated traits about them like their name, email, etc.

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("1hKOmRA4el9Zt1WSfVJIVo4GRlm", {
  name: "Alex Keener",
  email: "alex@example.com",
  plan: "GOLD",
  age: 40,
})
```

<div class="infoBlock">

In the cloud mode, the above <code class="inline-code">identify</code> call is sent with the name as <code class="inline-code">identify</code> along with any additional properties passed to it.
</div>

## Track

A [`track`](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/) call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Clicked button", {
  color: "red",
  buttonText: "Get started",
})
```

The `eventTypeId` argument (**Clicked button** in the above example) in `track` call should meet the following requirements:
- Start with a letter or number
- Contain 80 characters or less
- Contain only letters, numbers, hyphen, underscore, or period.

<div class="infoBlock">

</div>


## Page

A [`page`](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/) call lets you record your website's page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.

A sample `page` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page("homepage", "home", {
  url: "https://abc.com",

})
```

<div class="infoBlock">

In the cloud mode, the above <code class="inline-code">page</code> call is sent with the name as <code class="inline-code">Viewed_home_page</code> along with any additional properties passed to it.
</div>

## Screen

The [`screen`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/screen/) call lets you record whenever the user views their mobile screen, with any additional relevant information about the screen.

A sample `screen` call is shown below:

```javascript
[[RSClient sharedInstance] screen:@"Main" properties:@{@"prop_key" : @"prop_value"}];
```

The above snippet captures information related to the screen being viewed, such as screen's name and category.

<div class="infoBlock">

The above call is sent with the name <code class="inline-code">Viewed_Main_screen</code> along with any additional properties passed to it.
</div>

## Group

The [`group`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/group/) call lets you link an identified user with a group such as a company, organization, or an account, and record any traits associated with that group, for example, company name, number of employees, etc.

A sample `group` call is shown below:
