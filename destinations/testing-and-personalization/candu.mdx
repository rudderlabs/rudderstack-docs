## Getting started

Before configuring Candu as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Candu by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile**    | **Server**    |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ |
| **Device mode**     | -             | -             | -             |
| **Cloud mode**      | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

## Connection settings

To successfully configure Candu as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

- **API Key**: Your API Key is the unique key generated against your Candu account. You can find it under the **Settings** > **Workspaces** > **Access Keys** section of your Candu account. Refer to the [FAQ section](#faq) for more details.


## Identify

The `identify` call lets you capture the details of a visiting user along with any associated traits such as their name, email address, etc.

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("webUser01", {
  email: "abc@mail.com",
  firstName: "Name",
  lastName: "LastName",
  phoneNumber: "22222222",
  dateOfBirth: "xxxx-xx-xx",
  custom_fields: {
    key1: "value1",
    key2: "value2",
  },
});
}
```


## Track

The `track` call lets you capture user events along with the properties associated with them.

A sample `track` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track('Promotion Clicked', {
  promotion_id: 'promo1',
  creative: 'banner1',
  name: 'sale',
  position: 'home_top'
});
```

<div class="warningBlock">

When sending events to Candu, make an `identify` call before the `track` call. This ensures that no duplicate user identities are created in the Candu platform.
