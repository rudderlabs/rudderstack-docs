# LaunchDarkly

[**LaunchDarkly**](https://launchdarkly.com/) is a popular feature management platform that offers cutting-edge A/B testing and experimentation functionalities. It lets you efficiently automate and manage feature flags and improve overall product workflow and software quality.

RudderStack supports LaunchDarkly as a destination to which you can seamlessly send your data for flag management.

## Getting started

Before configuring LaunchDarkly as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by LaunchDarkly by referring to the table below:

| Connection Mode     | Web           | Mobile                 | Server        |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :--------------------- | :-------------|
| **Device mode**     | **Supported**             | -                      | -            |
| **Cloud mode**      | - | -          | - |

<div class="infoBlock">
 
 To know more about the difference between cloud mode and device mode in RudderStack, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/">RudderStack connection modes</a> guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that your source platform supports sending events to LaunchDarkly, follow these steps:

* From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **LaunchDarkly**.

<div class="infoBlock">
 
 Refer to the guide on <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/">Adding a Source and Destination in RudderStack</a> for more information.
</div>

* Assign a name to the destination and click on **Next**. You should then see the following screen:

## Identify

The `identify` call lets you create a new user in LaunchDarkly or update an existing one. 

A sample `identify` call is as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify(
  "userId", {
    anonymous: false,
    avatar: "https://avatarfiles.alphacoders.com/837/83744.jpg",
    country: "India",
    custom: {
      favourite_color: "black"
    },
    email: "name@domain.com",
    firstName: "Test",
    ip: "10.11.23.22",
    lastName: "User",
    name: "Test User",
    privateAttribureNames: ["avatar", "country"],
    secondary: "abcd21234"
  }
);
```

The following table lists the supported fields for the `traits` object in the `identify` call:

| Field | Type | Presence | Description | 
|:------|:-----|:---------|:-------------|
| `anonymous`    | Boolean | Optional | Must be set to `true`  |
| `avatar` | String | Optional | User's avatar image URL |
| `country` | String | Optional | Country associated with the user |
| `custom` | Object | Optional | Additional attributes associated with the user |
| `email` | String | Optional | User's email address |
| `firstName` | String | Optional | User's first name |
| `ip` | String | Optional | User's IP address |
| `lastName` | String | Optional | User's last name |
| `name` | String | Optional | User's full name |
| `privateAttributeNames` | String Array | Optional | List of attribute names (built-in or custom) marked as private and not sent to LaunchDarkly as analytics events |
| `secondary` | String | Optional | User's secondary identifier |

<div class="infoBlock">

If you have chosen to bucket the users by a specific attribute, the <code class="inline-code">secondary</code> field can be used to further distinguish users who are otherwise identical as per that attribute. 
</div>

### LaunchDarkly key

RudderStack assigns the `userId` to LaunchDarkly's `key` field to uniquely identify a user.

<div class="infoBlock">

<code class="inline-code">key</code> is the only required field in LaunchDarkly's <code class="inline-code">identify</code> call, where RudderStack maps the unique user identifier (<code class="inline-code">userId</code>). If no unique identifier is provided, RudderStack will automatically assign <code class="inline-code">anonymousId</code> as <code class="inline-code">key</code>.
</div>

## Track

The `track` call lets you record user events and send them to LaunchDarkly as custom conversion metrics for your experiments.

A sample `track` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track("Test Event", {
  foo: "bar"
});
```

## Alias

The `alias` call lets you merge different identities of a known user. You can explicitly change the identity of a user via this call.

A sample `alias` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.alias("newUserId","userId");
```
