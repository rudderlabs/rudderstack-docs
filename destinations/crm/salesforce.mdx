# Salesforce

[**Salesforce**](https://www.salesforce.com/in/?ir=1) is an industry leader in enterprise CRM. It offers a suite of enterprise applications revolving around marketing automation, customer engagement and support, application development as well as analytics.

RudderStack lets you identify your leads in Salesforce without having to use the REST APIs.

**Find the open-source transformer code for this destination in our** [**GitHub repo**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-transformer/tree/master/v0/destinations/salesforce)**.**
</div>

## Getting Started

Before configuring your source and destination on the RudderStack, please verify if the source platform is supported by Salesforce by referring to the table below:

| **Connection Mode** | **Web** | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Device mode** | - | - | - |
| **Cloud** **mode** | **Supported** | **Supported** | **Supported** |

<div class="infoBlock">

To know more about the difference between Cloud mode and Device mode in RudderStack, read the [**RudderStack connection modes**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/) guide.
</div>

Once you have confirmed that the source supports sending events to Salesforce, follow these steps:

* From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderlabs.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **Salesforce**.

<div class="infoBlock">

Follow our guide on [**How to Add a Source and Destination in RudderStack**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/) to add a source and destination in RudderStack.
</div>

* Give a name to the destination and click on **Next**. You should then see the following screen:

<span class="imageTitle">Salesforce Connection Settings</span>

* Provide your Salesforce username and password here along with the access token.
* If you are using a Sandbox environment for integration, enable the **Sandbox Mode** option. Then, click on **Next**. Salesforce will now be enabled as a destination in RudderStack.

<div class="infoBlock">

</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

We **recommend** that you create a new Salesforce account to use it with RudderStack. This will protect any confidential information present in your existing Salesforce account. However, this is **entirely optional**. You can also use your existing Salesforce account.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

To create a new account, go to **Setup** - **Administration Setup** - **Users** - **New User** and create a **System Administrator** profile. This should give RudderStack the required permissions to access the API.
</div>

## Identify

RudderStack makes it very easy for you to get your leads from your website or mobile app into Salesforce through the `identify` call.

### Identifying a Potential Lead

The following code snippet demonstrates a sample `identify` call in RudderStack:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify('userid', {
  name: 'John Doe',
  title: 'CEO',
  email: 'name.surname@domain.com',
  company: 'Company123',
  phone: '123-456-7890',
  state: 'Texas',
  rating: 'Hot',
  city: 'Austin',
  postalCode: '12345',
  country: 'US',
  street: 'Sample Address',
  state: 'TX'
}, {
  'integrations': {
    'Salesforce': true
  }
});
```

This snippet identifies a unique user based on the `userid` and the associated traits passed in the `identify` call.

When the `identify` method is called, RudderStack checks if the lead already exists using the `email` property. If yes, the lead is updated with the traits passed in the `identify` call. If no lead exists, a new lead is created in Salesforce.

<div class="infoBlock">
  
  If a lead is already converted into a contact, RudderStack will map the user ID to <code class="inline-code">contactId</code>. Otherwise, the user ID will be mapped to the <code class="inline-code">leadId</code>.
</div>

<div class="warningBlock">

It is mandatory to include `'Salesforce':true` in every Salesforce integration object. As Salesforce has strict API limits, this is required in order to prevent the users from hitting their limits. By default, RudderStack does not send `identify` calls to Salesforce. Hence, any `identify` call that does not include `'Salesforce':true` in its payload will be ignored.
</div>

### Updating Custom Fields in Salesforce

<div class="infoBlock">

If you wish to update custom fields in Salesforce using RudderStack, make sure that you first create those lead fields in Salesforce before sending the data through RudderStack. For more information on how to do this, check out the [**Salesforce docs**](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.adding_fields.htm&type=5).
</div>

As `lastName` and `company` are needed by the [**Salesforce Leads API**](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_objects_lead.htm), the absence of either of these fields will result in RudderStack automatically appending the `'n/a'`string to both the fields - even if they have been specified in some previous request.

For example, if you wish to collect a custom trait in RudderStack named `newProp`, create a field label named `newProp`. This will generate an API name as `newProp__c`. RudderStack automatically appends the `__c` to any custom trait.

<div class="infoBlock">

**Make sure you are consistent with your casing**. If the custom fields are created in camelCase, make sure sure that you send the traits to RudderStack in camelCase. If you're creating custom fields in snake\_case, make sure you send the traits in the same format.
</div>

## Updating Salesforce Objects

You can create or update any [**Salesforce Object**](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_list.htm) using the `identify` event. To specify the object type, follow the schema below.

RudderStack will look for the key `externalId` under `context` and determine the Salesforce Object type by removing the part `Salesforce-` from the field `type`. It will then make a `PATCH` request if there is an `id` present in the request to update the record. Otherwise, a new record will be created.

You can pass multiple object types in a single request and RudderStack will create that many requests to Salesforce.

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify('123456',
    {
      FirstName: "John",
      LastName: "Gibbs",
      Email: "john@peterson.com"
    },
    {
      externalId: [
        {
          type: "Salesforce-Contact",
          id: "sf-contact-id"
        }
      ]
    });
```

In the example above, RudderStack updates the `Contact` object in Salesforce with `id` as `sf-contact-id` and send the `traits` object to Salesforce.

<div class="infoBlock">

By default, RudderStack creates a `Lead` object in Salesforce and maps the `traits` to it, as mentioned above. For other objects, RudderStack does not modify the `traits`; they are sent to Salesforce as it is.
</div>

## FAQs

### Which Salesforce Edition should I use to access the API?

Before connecting to the Salesforce API with RudderStack, make sure you are using the right edition of Salesforce. You can follow [**this guide**](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000326486&type=1&mode=1) to know more about the supported editions with the API access. You must have either the **Enterprise**, **Unlimited**, **Developer** or **Performance** editions to access the API.

### Where do I get the Security Token?

You can find your Security Token under **Setup** - **Personal Setup** - **My Personal Information** - [**Reset My Security Token**](https://na15.salesforce.com/_ui/system/security/ResetApiTokenEdit).

If you still face any issues, feel free to contact us.

### How to check the number of Salesforce API calls left for the day?

To check the number of Salesforce API calls, go to **Setup** - **Administration Setup** - **Company Profile** - **Company Information**. You should be able to see a field called **API Requests, Last 24 Hours**, which contains the number of APIs calls left for the day.

### What if I don't include `'Salesforce': true` in my `identify` call?

Salesforce has a very strict API limit. Moreover, RudderStack by default does not send `identify` calls to Salesforce. If you don't include `'Salesforce':true` in your `identify` call payload, the call will be simply ignored.
