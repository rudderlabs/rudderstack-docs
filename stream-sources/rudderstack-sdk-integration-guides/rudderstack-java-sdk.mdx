  Detailed technical documentation on using RudderStack’s Java SDK to send
  events to various destinations
---

# Java

RudderStack’s Java SDK allows you to track your customer event data from your Java code. Once enabled, the event requests hit the RudderStack servers. RudderStack then routes the events to the specified destination platforms as configured by you.

You can find this SDK in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-java).

## Installing the RudderStack Java SDK

<div class="warningBlock">

**As Bintray has sunset from 1st may, 2021, we're moving our SDK to Maven Central. All the versions from 1.0.1 will now be available in Maven Central only.**

</div>

We distribute our Java SDK through [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org). The recommended and easiest way to add the SDK to your project is through the Maven build system.

To install the RudderStack Java SDK, add the following lines of code to `pom.xml`:

```markup
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.rudderstack.sdk.java</groupId>
     <artifactId>rudderanalytics-client</artifactId>
   <version>1.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

## Initializing the RudderStack Client

To initialize the RudderStack client, run the following code snippet:

```java
RudderAnalytics analytics = RudderAnalytics.builder(
        WRITE_KEY,
        DATA_PLANE_URL
).build();
```

## Sending Events from RudderStack

Once the RudderStack client is initialized, you can use it to send relevant customer events from the RudderStack client. An example `track` call is as shown in the following code snippet:

```java
Map<String, Object> properties = new LinkedHashMap<>();
    properties.put("key1", "value1");
    properties.put("key2", "value2");
    analytics.enqueue(
       TrackMessage.builder("Java Test")
           .properties(properties)
           .anonymousId(anonymousId)
           .userId(userId)
);
```

## Identify

The `identify` call lets you associate a user to their actions as well as captures the relevant traits or properties related to that user.

<div class="infoBlock">

For a detailed explanation of the <code class="inline-code">identify</code> call, please refer to our <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/identify/">RudderStack API Specification</a> guide.

## Alias

The `alias` call allows you to associate one identity with another.

For a detailed explanation of the <code class="inline-code">alias</code> call, please refer to our <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/alias/">RudderStack API Specification</a> guide.

</div>

## Block Flush

<div class="infoBlock">

This feature is only available from version <code class="inline-code">1.0.1</code> onwards.

</div>

If you want to block `flush` until all the events are uploaded , the Java SDK has a builder method called `synchronize()` with default value `false` which needs to be set to `true` .

An example for blocking the `flush` is shown:

```java
RudderAnalytics analytics = RudderAnalytics.builder(
        WRITE_KEY,
        DATA_PLANE_URL
)
// optional (default : false).
// It is required to block further method invocation until the flush completes.
.synchronize(true)
.plugin(new PluginLog()) // optional. Used for Logging
.build();

// ...YOUR CODE...

// optional. Triggers a flush and block until the flush completes.
// Required in case of Synchronize.
// It calls implicitly the `flush` method.
// So, explicit `flush` call is not required.
analytics.blockFlush();
analytics.shutdown(); // Shut down after the flush is complete.
```

## FAQ

### Can I use the ImmutableMap class?

Yes. You need to use the Guava library. You can also use the plain old Java Maps instead.
