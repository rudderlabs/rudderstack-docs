  Detailed technical documentation on using RudderStack’s Rust SDK to send events to various destinations.
---


# Rust

RudderStack’s Rust SDK allows you to track your customer event data from your Rust applications.

Once configured as a source, the event requests are sent to the RudderStack server. RudderStack then routes the events to the destination platforms as configured by you.

You can find the SDK implementation in our [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-rust).

## Installing the Rust SDK

To install the Rust SDK, add its crate as a project dependency.

Add the following line to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```rust
rudderanalytics = "1.0.0"
```

## Initializing the RudderStack client

To initialize the RudderStack client, run the following code snippet:

```rust
use rudderanalytics::client::RudderAnalytics;

let rudder_analytics = RudderAnalytics::load(
	"<SOURCE_WRITE_KEY>".to_string(),
	"<DATA_PLANE_URL>".to_string()
);
```

Once the RudderStack client is initialized, you can use it to send your customer events.

## Sending events from RudderStack

The Rust SDK supports the following events:

* Identify
* Track
* Page
* Group
* Screen
* Alias
* Batch

For more information on each of calls, refer to the [**RudderStack Events Specification**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/) guide.

<div class="warningBlock">
  
RudderStack does not store the user state in any of the server-side SDKs. Unlike the client-side SDKs that deal with only a single user at a given time, the server-side SDKs deal with multiple users simultaneously. Therefore, for any of the calls supported by the Rust SDK, you need to specify either the <code class="inline-code">user_id</code> or <code class="inline-code">anonymous_id</code> every time. 
</div>

## Identify

The `identify` call lets you associate a user to their actions as well as captures the relevant traits or properties related to that user.

<div class="infoBlock">

For a detailed explanation of the <code class="inline-code">identify</code> call, please refer to our <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/identify/">RudderStack API Specification</a> guide.

</div>

```php
Rudder::identify(array(

    "friends" => 25
