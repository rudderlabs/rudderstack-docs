# Cordova

[**Apache Cordova**](https://cordova.apache.org/) is an open-source, cross-platform application development framework. 

The **RudderStack Cordova SDK** lets you track event data from your Cordova applications and send it to your specified destinations via RudderStack.

Check the [**GitHub codebase**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-cordova) and the [**sample implementation**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-cordova/blob/master/sample-cordova/www/js/index.js) to get a more hands-on understanding of the SDK.

## SDK setup requirements

To set up the Cordova SDK, follow these steps:

- You will need to set up a [**RudderStack account**](https://app.rudderstack.com).
- Once signed up, set up a Cordova source in the dashboard. For more information, follow [**this guide**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/).  You should then see a **Write Key** for this source, as shown below:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-sources/cordova-sdk-1.png" alt="Cordova source write key" />

- You will also need a data plane URL. Follow [**this section**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack/#what-is-a-data-plane-url-where-do-i-get-it) for more information on the data plane URL and where to get it.

## Installing the Cordova SDK

To add the Cordova SDK as a dependency, navigate to the root folder of your application and run the following command:

```bash
cordova plugin add rudder-sdk-cordova
```

## Initializing the RudderStack client

After adding the SDK as a dependency, you need to set up the SDK. 

Add the following code in the `onDeviceReady()` function of your home page to initialize the SDK.

A sample Cordova SDK initialization is as shown:

```javascript
RudderClient.initialize(WRITE_KEY , {
  dataPlaneUrl: DATA_PLANE_URL
})
```

<div class="infoBlock">

  Make sure you use the <code class="inline-code">await</code> keyword with the <code class="inline-code">initialize</code> call.
</div>

The `setup` method has the following signature:

| Name | Data Type | Presence | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `writeKey` | `string` | Required | Your Cordova source `writeKey` from the dashboard. |
| `configuration` | `JSON Object` | Optional | Contains the RudderStack client configuration. |
| `options` | `JSON Object` | Optional | Extra options to be pass along with the event. |

<div class="infoBlock">
<ul>
<li>

Check the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-cordova-sdk/#configuring-the-rudderstack-client">Configuring the RudderStack Client</a> section below for detailed information on the parameters you can send in the <code class="inline-code">configuration</code> object.
</li>

</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Identify

The `identify` call lets you identify a visiting user and associate them with their actions. It also lets you record the traits about them like their name, email address, etc.

<div class="successBlock">

As a best practice, we recommend calling `identify` at the start of every session or page load for logged-in users. This will ensure all their latest traits are captured in all the subsequent events.
</div>

A sample `identify` call is as shown below:

```javascript
RudderClient.identify("userId", {
  address: {
    city: "LA",
    country: "USA",
    state: "CA",
  },
  birthday: "1984/07/17",
  company: {
    name: "RudderStack",
    id: "RS",
    industry: "IT",
  },
  email: "john@rudderstack.com",
  firstName: "john",
});
```

The `identify` method has the following signatures:

| Name | Data Type | Presence | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `userId` | `string` | Required | User identifier in your database. |
| `traits` | `JSON Object` | Optional | Information related to the user traits. |
| `options` | `JSON Object` | Optional | Extra options for the `identify` event. |

<div class="infoBlock">

Check the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-cordova-sdk/#configuring-your-options-object">Configuring the options object</a> section below for detailed information on the parameters you can send in the <code class="inline-code">options</code> object.
</div>

## Track

The `track` call lets you record the user actions along with their associated properties. Each user action is called an **event**.

A sample `track` event called `Order Completed` using the Cordova SDK is shown below:

```javascript
RudderClient.track('Order Completed', {
  checkout_id: '18310159091413-2',
  order_id: '1153390412189-01',
  affiliation: 'Google Play Store',
  total: 68.00,
  subtotal: 60.00,
  revenue: 70.00,
  shipping: 5,
  tax: 3,
  discount: 10,
  coupon: 'NEWUSER',
  currency: 'USD',
  products: [{
      product_id: '853913-410121910',
      sku: 'FF-21',
      name: 'Varsity Graphic T-Shirt',
      price: 25,
      quantity: 1,
      category: 'Clothing',
      url: 'https://www.myntra.com/tshirts/huetrap/huetrap-men-beige/111/buy',
    },
    {
      product_id: '113413-190158920',
      sku: 'GF-67',
      name: 'Printed Round Neck T-Shirt',
      price: 15,
      quantity: 3,
      category: 'Clothing'
    }
  ]
})
```

The `track` method has the following signature:

| Name | Data Type | Presence | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `name` | `String` | Required | Contains the name of the event that you want to track. |
| `properties` | `JSON Object` | Optional | Contains the extra properties to be sent along with the event. |
| `options` | `JSON Object` | Optional | Contains the extra event options. |

<div class="infoBlock">

Check the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-cordova-sdk/#configuring-your-options-object">Configuring the options object</a> section below for detailed information on the parameters you can send in the <code class="inline-code">options</code> object.
</div>

<div class="successBlock">

RudderStack automatically tracks the following optional events:

<ul>
<li><code class="inline-code">Application Installed</code></li>
<li><code class="inline-code">Application Opened</code></li>
</ul>

You can disable these events by sending the property <code class="inline-code">trackLifecycleEvents</code> as <code class="inline-code">false</code> within the <code class="inline-code">configuration</code> object while initializing the RudderStack client. However, we highly recommend keeping them enabled.
</div>

## Group

The `group` call lets you associate an identified user to a group - either a company, project, or a team, and record any custom traits or properties associated with that group.

A sample `group` call is as shown:

```javascript
RudderClient.group("group1", {
  groupname: "RS",
  groupwork: "Mobile dev"
})
```

The `group` method has the following signatures:

| Name | Data Type | Presence | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `groupId` | `string` | Required | The organization ID with which you want to associate the user. |
| `groupTraits` | `JSON Object` | Optional | Any other property of the organization that you want to pass along with the call. |
| `options` | `JSON Object` | Optional | Extra options for the `group` event. |

<div class="infoBlock">

Check the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-cordova-sdk/#configuring-your-options-object">Configuring the options object</a> section below for detailed information on the parameters you can send in the <code class="inline-code">options</code> object.
</div>

## Screen

The `screen` call lets you record whenever your user views their mobile screen with any additional relevant information about the viewed screen.

A sample `screen` call is shown below:

```javascript
RudderClient.screen("Home Screen", {
  mobile: "pixel"
})
```

The `screen` method has the following signature:

| Name | Data Type | Presence | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `screenName` | `string` | Required | Name of the viewed screen. |
| `property` | `JSON Object` | Optional | Extra properties that you want to pass along with the `screen` call. |
| `options` | `JSON Object` | Optional | Extra options to be passed along with `screen` event. |

<div class="infoBlock">

Check the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-cordova-sdk/#configuring-your-options-object">Configuring the options object</a> section below for detailed information on the parameters you can send in the <code class="inline-code">options</code> object.
</div>

## Alias

The `alias` call lets you merge different identities of a known user.

<div class="infoBlock">

<code class="inline-code">alias</code> is an advanced method that lets you change the tracked user's ID explicitly. This method is useful when managing identities for some of the downstream destinations.
</div>

A sample `alias` call is shown below:

```javascript
RudderClient.alias("userId")
```

The `alias` method has the following signature:

| Name | Data Type | Presence | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `newId` | `String` | Required | The new `userId` that you want to assign to the user. |
| `options` | `JSON Object` | Optional | Event level options. |

<div class="infoBlock">

Check the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-cordova-sdk/#configuring-your-options-object">Configuring the options object</a> section below for detailed information on the parameters you can send in the <code class="inline-code">options</code> object.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

For a detailed explanation of the <code class="inline-code">alias</code> call, refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/alias/">RudderStack API Specification</a> guide.
</div>

## Reset

You can use the `reset` method to clear the persisted `traits` from the `identify` call. We recommend calling it during the `Logout` operation.

A sample `reset` call is as shown:

```javascript
RudderClient.reset()
```

## Enabling/disabling user tracking via the optOut API \(GDPR support\)

RudderStack gives the users \(e.g., an EU user\) the ability to opt out of tracking any user activity until the user gives their consent. You can do this by leveraging RudderStack's `optOut` API.

The `optOut` API takes `true` or `false` as a Boolean value to enable or disable tracking user activities. This flag persists across the device reboots.

The following snippet highlights the use of the `optOut` API to disable user tracking:

```javascript
RudderClient.optOut(true);
```

Once the user grants their consent, you can enable user tracking once again by using the `optOut` API with `false` as a parameter sent to it, as shown:

```javascript
RudderClient.optOut(false);
```

<div class="infoBlock">
  
 The <code class="inline-code">optOut</code> API is available in the Cordova SDK starting from version <code class="inline-code">1.0.1</code>. 
</div>

## Configuring the RudderStack client

You can configure your RudderStack client by passing the following parameters in the `configuration` object of your `RudderClient.initialize()` call:

| Parameter | Type | Description | Default Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `logLevel` | `RudderClient.LogLevel` | Controls how much of the log you want to see from the Cordova SDK. | `RudderClient.LogLevel.None` |
| `dataPlaneUrl` | `string` | Your RudderStack Data Plane URL. | [**https://hosted.rudderlabs.com**](https://hosted.rudderlabs.com) |
| `flushQueueSize` | `int` | The number of events included in a batch request to the server. | `30` |
| `dbThresholdCount` | `int` | The number of events to be saved in the `SQLite` database. Once the limit is reached, older events are deleted from the database. | `10000` |
| `sleepTimeout` | `int` | Minimum waiting time to flush the events to the server. | `10 seconds` |
| `configRefreshInterval` | `int` | RudderStack fetches the config after this time interval. | `2` |
| `trackLifecycleEvents` | `boolean` | Determines if the SDK should capture the application life cycle events automatically. | `true` |

## Configuring the `options` object

A sample `options` object that can be sent along with all the above-mentioned API calls is as shown:

```javascript
{
  "externalIds": {
    "brazeExternalId": "externalId1"
  }
}
```

The `options` object has the following signature:

| Name | Data Type | Presence | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `externalIds` | `JSON Object` | Optional | Each key within `externalIds` object should define the type of external ID, and its value should be a `String` or `Integer`. |
| `integrations` | `JSON Object` | Optional | Each key within the `integrations` object should hold the display name of your desired destination. Its value should be a `boolean` indicating whether you want to send that event or not. For more details check the [**Enabling/disabling events for specific destinations**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-cordova-sdk/#enablingdisabling-events-for-specific-destinations) section below. |

## Enabling/disabling events for specific destinations

RudderStack lets you send your event data only to the explicitly specified destinations and filtering out the rest. You can do this in one of the following two ways:

* While initializing the Cordova SDK
* While making the event calls

### Passing destinations during SDK initialization

This approach is useful when you want to send the events to specific destinations across all the event calls made using the SDK.

A sample SDK initialization is shown below:

```javascript
RudderClient.initialize("1n0JdVPZTRUIkLXYccrWzZwdGSx", {
  dataPlaneUrl: "https://0ff6-175-101-36-4.ngrok.io",
  flushQueueSize: 30,
  dbCountThreshold: 10000,
  configRefreshInterval: 2,
  logLevel: 0,
  sleepTimeOut: 10,
  trackLifecycleEvents: true,
  recordScreenViews: true,
}, {
  integrations: {
    MixPanel: true,
    Amplitude: true
  }
})
```

### Passing destinations during event calls

This approach is useful when you want to send particular events to specific destinations, or if you want to override the destinations specified during the SDK initialization for a particular event.

An example is shown below:

```javascript
RudderClient.screen("Home Screen", {
  mobile: "pixel"
}, {
  integrations: {
    All: false,
    Salesforce: true
  }
})
```

In the above example, the values of the `screen` call are passed only to the Salesforce destination.

## Anonymous ID

RudderStack uses the `deviceId` as anonymousId by default. You can use the `putAnonymousId` method to override the default `anonymousId`, as shown:

```javascript
RudderClient.putAnonymousId("CustomAnonymousId");
```

## Advertisement ID

RudderStack collects the advertisement ID if it is enabled by the user. To set the advertising ID yourself, you can use the `putAdvertisingId` method as shown:

```javascript
RudderClient.putAdvertisingId("SampleAdvertisingId")
```
<div class="warningBlock">

On iOS, you need to call the <code class="inline-code">putAdvertisingId</code> method before calling <code class="inline-code">initialize</code>.
</div>

## Setting the device token

You can pass your `device-token` for push notifications to be passed to the destinations which support the **Push Notifications** feature. RudderStack sets the `token` under `context.device.token`.

An example of setting the `device-token` is as shown:

```javascript
RudderClient.putDeviceToken("sampleDeviceToken");
```

## Debugging

If you face any unexpected behavior while using the SDK, you can turn on the `VERBOSE` or `DEBUG` logging feature to determine out the issue.

You configure logging behavior of your SDK by sending the value of the `logLevel` property of the `configuration` object and pass it over to the `initialize` call as shown below:

```javascript
RudderClient.initialize( WRITE_KEY , {
  dataPlaneUrl: DATA_PLANE_URL ,
  logLevel: RudderClient.LogLevel.VERBOSE,
  trackLifecycleEvents: true
})
```

## FAQs

### Where can I find the source write key?

Once you set up a Cordova source in the [**RudderStack dashboard**](http://app.rudderstack.com/), you will be able to view the source **Write Key**, under the **Overview** section, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-sources/cordova-sdk-1.png" alt="Cordova source write key" />

### Where can I find the data plane URL?

Refer to this [**section**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack/#what-is-a-data-plane-url-where-do-i-get-it) for more information on the data plane and how to get it.
