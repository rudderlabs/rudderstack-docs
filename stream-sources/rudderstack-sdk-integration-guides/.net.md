  Detailed technical documentation on using RudderStack’s .NET SDK to send
  events to various destinations
---

# .NET

RudderStack’s .NET SDK allows you to track your customer event data from your .NET application. Once enabled, the event requests hit the RudderStack servers. RudderStack then routes the events to the specified destination platforms as configured by you.

You can find this SDK in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-.net).

## Installing the RudderStack .NET SDK

You can use our .NET library for sending different events to RudderStack server. You can use [NuGet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/install-use-packages-powershell) to install our library into your project.

```csharp
Install-Package RudderAnalytics -Version <version>
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Our library depends on [Newton.JSON](http://json.codeplex.com/) library for JSON processing.
{% endhint %}

## Initializing the RudderStack Client

To initialize the RudderStack client, run the following code snippet:

```csharp
using RudderStack;

RudderAnalytics.Initialize(
  YOUR_WRITE_KEY,
  new RudderConfig(dataPlaneUrl: DATA_PLANE_URL)
);
```

## Sending Events from RudderStack

Once the RudderStack client is initialized, you can then use it to send relevant customer events. 

An example `track` call is as shown:

```csharp
RudderAnalytics.Client.Track(
  "userId",
  "CTA Clicked",
  new Dictionary<string, object> { {"plan", "premium"}, }
);
```
