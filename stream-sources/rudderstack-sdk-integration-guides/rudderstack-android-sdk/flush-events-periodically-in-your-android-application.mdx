# How to Flush Events Periodically in Your Android App

RudderStack supports periodic flushing of events from the Android SDK to RudderStack, irrespective of whether your app is opened or not. This ensures that the events that are triggered just before closing the app are sent from the device - even if the app is not opened by the user for a long time.

To use this feature, follow these steps:

1. Open your `app/build.gradle` and add the WorkManager dependency under `dependencies` as shown below:

```groovy
implementation 'androidx.work:work-runtime:2.7.1'
```

2. Use `withFlushPeriodically()` function while passing the `RudderConfig` object to the `getInstance()` API, as shown below:

```kotlin
rudderClient = RudderClient.getInstance(
  this,
  WRITE_KEY,
  RudderConfig.Builder()
  .withDataPlaneUrl(DATA_PLANE_URL)
  // enabling periodical flush of events in the DB with a repeat interval of 15 minutes
  .withFlushPeriodically(15, TimeUnit.MINUTES)
  .build()
)
```
## `withFlushPeriodically` Parameters

The `withFlushPeriodically` function takes two parameters:

* The first parameter is the time interval for the periodic flush worker to be repeated.
* The second parameter is the time unit of the repeat interval. It can be Minutes, Hours or Days. The minimum value of the repeat interval is 15 minutes.

## Initializing WorkManager on demand

By default, the WorkManager is initialized on the startup of the application. However, you can initialize it only on demand by following the below steps:

1. Add the below `provider` to the application tag of your application’s `AndroidManifest.xml`.

```xml
<provider
    android:name="androidx.startup.InitializationProvider"
    android:authorities="${applicationId}.androidx-startup"
    android:exported="false"
    tools:node="merge">
    <!-- If you are using androidx.startup to initialize other components -->
    <meta-data
        android:name="androidx.work.WorkManagerInitializer"
        android:value="androidx.startup"
        tools:node="remove" />
 </provider>
 ```

2. Implement `Configuration.Provider` and define the function `getWorkManagerConfiguration()` in your application class as shown below:

```kotlin
class MyApplication(): Application(), Configuration.Provider {

  override fun getWorkManagerConfiguration() =
    Configuration.Builder()
    .setMinimumLoggingLevel(android.util.Log.INFO)
    .build()
}
```
