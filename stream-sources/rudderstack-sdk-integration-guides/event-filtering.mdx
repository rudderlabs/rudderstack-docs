# Event Filtering

RudderStack's event filtering feature lets you specify which events should be discarded or allowed to flow through by whitelisting or blacklisting them.

<div class="successBlock">

The event filtering feature can be used for all the RudderStack destinations that support <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode">device mode</a>.

Refer to <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/#how-to-check-if-a-destination-supports-cloud-mode-or-device-mode-or-both">this section</a> for more information. 
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

Event filtering is applicable only for <code class="inline-code">track</code> calls.

## Event filtering options

RudderStack gives you the ability to configure your event filtering options while setting up your device mode destination in the dashboard, as shown:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-sources/rudderstack-event-filtering.png" alt="Event filtering options" />

You will see the following dropdown options under **Event Filtering**, in the **Connection Settings** page:

### Disable

Event filtering will be disabled if you select this option from the dropdown. In this case, RudderStack will not filter any events and allow all events to flow through.

### Whitelist

Upon selecting the **Whitelist** option from the dropdown, you can specify the names of the events that you want RudderStack to **allow** or flow through to the destination. 

<div class="infoBlock">

If you choose the <strong>Whitelist</strong> option for event filtering, any events specified in the <strong>Blacklist</strong> field will be ignored.
</div>

You can add as many events as you want to the whitelist by clicking on the **Add More** option.

<div class="warningBlock">

RudderStack will discard any event that is not specified in the whitelist. This also means that if you do not specify any events in the whitelist, <strong>all</strong> the calls will be discarded.
</div>

### Blacklist

Upon selecting the **Blacklist** option from the dropdown, you can specify the names of the events that you want RudderStack to **discard**. These events will not be sent to the destination.

<div class="infoBlock">

If you choose the <strong>Blacklist</strong> option for event filtering, any events specified in the <strong>Whitelist</strong> field will be ignored.
</div>

You can add as many events as you want to the blacklist by clicking on the **Add More** option.

<div class="warningBlock">

RudderStack will only discard the events explicitly specified in the blacklist. If you do not specify any events in the blacklist, then <strong>all</strong> the calls will be allowed to go through.
</div>
