  Detailed technical documentation on RudderStackâ€™s React Native SDK to send
  events from your React Native application to various destinations.
---

# React Native

The **RudderStack React Native SDK** allows you to track event data from your React Native applications and send it to your specified destinations via RudderStack.

You can check the [**GitHub codebase**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-react-native) to get a more hands-on understanding of the SDK.

## SDK setup requirements

To set up the RudderStack React Native SDK, the following prerequisites must be met:

- You will need to set up a [**RudderStack account**](https://app.rudderstack.com).
- Once signed up, set up a React Native source in the dashboard. For more information, follow [**this guide**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack/).  You should then see a **Write Key** for this source, as shown below:

<img src="../../assets/event-stream-sources/react-native-1.png" alt="React Native source write key" />

- You will also need a data plane URL. Follow [**this section**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack/#what-is-a-data-plane-url-where-do-i-get-it) for more information on the data plane URL and where to get it.

- We also recommend setting up the [**React Native development environment**](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) on your system.

## Installing the React Native SDK

The recommended way to install the React Native SDK is through [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rudderstack/rudder-sdk-react-native).

To add the SDK as a dependency, perform the following steps:

- Go to the root of your application and add `@rudderstack/rudder-sdk-react-native` as a dependency as shown:

<Tabs>
  <TabList>
    <Tab>npm</Tab>
    <Tab>yarn</Tab>
  </TabList>
    <TabPanels>
      <TabPanel>
<span>

```bash
npm install @rudderstack/rudder-sdk-react-native --save
```
</span>  
      </TabPanel>
      <TabPanel>
<span>

```bash
yarn add @rudderstack/rudder-sdk-react-native
```
</span>
      </TabPanel>
    </TabPanels>
</Tabs>


- Navigate to your Application's iOS folder and install all the required pods with:

```bash
pod install
```

## Initializing the RudderStack client

After adding the SDK as a dependency, you need to set up the SDK.

- Make sure you import the SDK as shown:

```typescript
import rudderClient from "@rudderstack/rudder-sdk-react-native"
```

- Add the following code in your application:

```typescript
await rudderClient.setup(WRITE_KEY, {
  dataPlaneUrl: DATA_PLANE_URL,
  trackLifecycleEvents: true,
  recordScreenViews: true,
})
```

<div class="successBlock">

  We highly recommend using the <code class="inline-code">await</code> keyword with the setup call.
</div>

The `setup` method has the following signature:

| Name            | Data Type     | Required | Description                                   |
| :-------------- | :------------ | :------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| `writeKey`      | `string`      | Yes      | Your React Native `writeKey`                  |
| `configuration` | `JSON Object` | No       | Contains the RudderStack Client configuration |

Check the [**Configuring your RudderStack client**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-react-native-sdk/#configuring-your-rudderstack-client) section below for a full list of configurable parameters.

## Track

You can record the user activity through the `track` method. Every user action is called an **event**.

A sample `track` event is shown below:

```typescript
rudderClient.track("test_track_event", {
  test_key_1: "test_value_1",
  test_key_2: {
    test_child_key_1: "test_child_value_1",
  },
})
```

The `track` method has the following signature:

| Name       | Data Type     | Required | Description                                                 |
| :--------- | :------------ | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`     | `string`      | Yes      | Name of the event you want to track                         |
| `property` | `JSON Object` | No       | Extra data properties you want to send along with the event |
| `options`  | `JSON Object` | No       | Extra event options                                         |

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack automatically tracks the following optional events:
<ol>
<li><code class="inline-code">Application Installed</code></li>
<li><code class="inline-code">Application Updated</code></li>
<li><code class="inline-code">Application Opened</code></li>
<li><code class="inline-code">Application Backgrounded</code></li>
</ol>
You can disable these events by passing <code class="inline-code">trackLifecycleEvents</code> as <code class="inline-code">false</code> in the configuration object. However, we recommend keeping them enabled.
</div>

## Identify

RudderStack captures the `deviceId` and uses it as the `anonymousId` for identifying the user. This helps in tracking the users across the application installation. To attach more information to the user, you can use the `identify` method. Once you set the `identify` information to the user, the SDK persists the user information and passes it to the subsequent `track` or `screen` calls. To reset the user identification, you can use the `reset` method.

A sample `identify` event is as shown:

```typescript
rudderClient.identify(
  "test_userId",
  {
    email: "testuser@example.com",
    location: "UK",
  },
  null
)
```

The `identify` method has the following signature:

| Name     | Data Type     | Required | Description                            |
| :------- | :------------ | :------- | :------------------------------------- |
| `userId` | `string`      | Yes      | Developer identity for the user        |
| `traits` | `JSON Object` | No       | Traits information for user            |
| `option` | `JSON Object` | No       | Extra options for the `identify` event |

## Screen

You can use the `screen` call to record whenever the user sees a screen on the mobile device. You can also send some extra properties along with this event.

An example of the `screen` event is as shown:

```typescript
rudderClient.screen("Main Activity", {
  foo: "bar",
})
```

Alternatively, you can use the following method signature:

| Name         | Data Type     | Required | Description                                                               |
| :----------- | :------------ | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `screenName` | `string`      | Yes      | Name of the screen viewed by the user.                                               |
| `property`   | `JSON Object` | No       | Extra property object that you want to pass along with the `screen` call. |
| `option`     | `JSON Object` | No       | Extra options to be passed along with `screen` event.                     |

<div class="infoBlock">

You can also enable automatic recording of screen views by passing <code class="inline-code">recordScreenViews</code> as <code class="inline-code">true</code> while initializing the <code class="inline-code">rudderClient</code>.  
The default value for <code class="inline-code">recordScreenViews</code> is <code class="inline-code">false</code>.
</div>

## Reset

You can use the `reset` method to clear the persisted `traits` for the `identify` call. This is required for `Logout` operations.

```typescript
await rudderClient.reset()
```

<div class="successBlock">

  It is highly recommended to use the <code class="inline-code">await</code>
  keyword with the reset call.
</div>

## Enabling/disabling user tracking via the optOut API \(GDPR support\)

RudderStack gives the users \(e.g., an EU user\) the ability to opt out of tracking any user activity until the user gives their consent. You can do this by leveraging RudderStack's `optOut` API.

The `optOut` API takes `true` or `false` as a Boolean value to enable or disable tracking user activities. This flag persists across device reboots.

The following snippet highlights the use of the `optOut` API to disable user tracking:

```typescript
await rudderClient.optOut(true)
```

Once the user grants their consent, you can enable user tracking once again by using the `optOut` API with `false` as a parameter sent to it, as shown:

```typescript
await rudderClient.optOut(false)
```

<div class="infoBlock">

The `optOut` API is available in the React Native SDK starting from version `1.0.14`.
</div>


## Registering callbacks

The React Native SDK lets you trigger a callback once any device-mode integration is successful. You can use this callback to perform any operation that you wanted to do once a device-integration is successful.

An example of registering a callback for `App Center` is as shown:

```typescript
await rc.registerCallback("App Center", () => {
  console.log("App Center is ready")
})
```

The `registerCallback` method has the following signatures:

| Name              | Data Type  | Required | Description                                                                   |
| :---------------- | :--------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `destinationName` | `string`   | Yes      | Display name of the device-mode destination.                                  |
| `callback`        | `Function` | Yes      | Callback function to be triggered once device-mode integration is successful. |

## Filtering events

When sending events to a destination via the [**device mode**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode), you can explicitly specify which events should be discarded or allowed to flow through - by whitelisting or blacklisting them.

<div class="infoBlock">

Refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/event-filtering/">Event Filtering</a> guide for more information on this feature.
</div>

## Enabling/disabling events for specific destinations

The React Native SDK lets you enable or disable sending events to a specific destination or all the destinations to which the source is connected. You can specify these destinations by creating an object as shown:

```typescript
const options = {
  integrations: {
    // default value for `All` is true
    All: false,
    // specifying destination by its display name
    Amplitude: true,
    Mixpanel: false,
  },
}
```

<div class="infoBlock">

The keyword <code class="inline-code">All</code> in the above snippet represents all the destinations the source is connected to. Its value is set to <code class="inline-code">true</code> by default.

</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

Make sure the destination names that you pass while specifying the destinations should exactly match the names listed <a href="https://app.rudderstack.com/directory">here</a>.

</div>

There are two methods in which you can pass the destinations specified in the above snippet to the SDK:

### 1. Passing destinations while initializing the SDK

This is helpful when you want to enable or disable sending the events across all the event calls made using the SDK to the specified destinations.

```typescript
rudderClient.setup(WRITE_KEY, config, options)
```

### 2. Passing destinations while making event calls

This approach is helpful when you want to enable or disable sending only a particular event to the specified destinations, or if you want to override the specified destinations passed with the SDK initialization \(as described in the method above\) for a particular event.

```typescript
rudderClient.track(
  "test_track_event",
  {
    test_key_1: "test_value_1",
  },
  options
)
```

<div class="infoBlock">

If you specify the destinations both while initializing the SDK as well as while making an event call, then the destinations specified at the event level only will be considered.
</div>

## External ID

You can pass your custom `userId` along with standard `userId` in your `identify` calls. We add those values under `context.externalId`. The following code snippet shows a way to add `externalId` to your `identify` request.

```typescript
const options = {
  externalIds: [
    {
      id: "some_external_id_1",
      type: "brazeExternalId",
    },
  ],
}
rudderClient.identify(
  "test_userId",
  {
    email: "testuser@example.com",
    location: "UK",
  },
  options
)
```

## Configuring your RudderStack client

You can configure your client based on the following parameters by passing them in the `configuration` object of your `setup` call.

## Debugging

If you run into any issues regarding the RudderStack React Native SDK, you can turn on the `VERBOSE` or `DEBUG` logging to find out what the issue is.

First, make sure you modify your import statement to include `RUDDER_LOG_LEVEL` with:

```typescript
import rudderClient, {
  RUDDER_LOG_LEVEL,
} from "@rudderstack/rudder-sdk-react-native"
```

Then to turn on the logging, change your `RudderClient` initialization to the following:

```typescript
await rudderClient.setup(WRITE_KEY, {
  dataPlaneUrl: DATA_PLANE_URL,
  logLevel: RUDDER_LOG_LEVEL.DEBUG, // or VERBOSE
})
```

You can set the log level to one of the following values:

1. `NONE`
2. `ERROR`
3. `WARN`
4. `INFO`
5. `DEBUG`
6. `VERBOSE`

## Advertising ID

You can use the `putAdvertisingId` method to pass your Android and iOS AAID and IDFA respectively. The `putAdvertisingId` method accepts two `string` arguments :

- `androidId` : Your Android `advertisingId` \(AAID\)
- `iOSId` : Your iOS `advertisingId` \(IDFA\)

Example Usage:

```typescript
rudderClient.putAdvertisingId(AAID, IDFA)
```
<div class="warningBlock">

On iOS, you need to call the <code class="inline-code">putAdvertisingId</code> method before calling <code class="inline-code">setup()</code>.
</div>

## Anonymous ID

You can use the `putAnonymousId` method to pass your `anonymousId` and the SDK will use that instead of the `deviceId`. The `putAnonymousId` method accepts one `string` argument:

- `id`: The user's `anonymousId`.

An example of this method's usage is as shown:

```typescript
rudderClient.putAnonymousId(ANONYMOUS_ID)
```

## FAQs

### Do I need to link the SDK using the React Native link?

No, you don't need to link the SDK as it is auto-linked. If you have linked it using `react-native link` and are facing any issues, use `react-native unlink rudder-sdk-react-native` to unlink it.

### Can I use the SDK with a React Native application created with Expo?

No. The SDK is a React Native module, and currently, the expo doesn't support adding native modules. You can still [**eject**](https://docs.expo.dev/expokit/eject/) your Expo application and use the RudderStack [**Android**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-android-sdk/) and [**iOS**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-ios-sdk/) SDKs.

### What is the need to use the await keyword?

The functions exposed by the SDK are asynchronous in nature. If you want a synchronous behavior, you must use the `await` keyword. We highly recommend using the `await` keyword with the setup call to make sure that the SDK has been properly set up, before any further calls are made.

### Does the Android build fail after adding the SDK to your Application?

Please try using Android Studio to build your application. This should fix most of the errors.

### How do I get the user `traits` after making an `identify` call?

You can get the user traits after making an `identify` call as shown:

```typescript
const rudderContext = await rc.getRudderContext()
console.log("Traits are : " + JSON.stringify(rudderContext.traits))
```
