  Detailed technical documentation on using RudderStack’s PHP SDK to send events
  to various destinations
---

# PHP

RudderStack’s PHP SDK allows you to track your customer event data from your PHP code. Once enabled, the event requests hit the RudderStack servers. RudderStack then routes the events to the specified destination platforms as configured by you.

You can find this SDK in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-php-sdk).

## Installing the RudderStack PHP SDK

Install the RudderStack PHP SDK using the [composer](https://packagist.org/packages/rudderstack/rudder-php-sdk). You can also do so by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-php-sdk /my/app/folders/
```

You can use composer to install the SDK. Use the following command.

```bash
composer require rudderstack/rudder-php-sdk
```

## Initializing the RudderStack Client

To initialize the RudderStack client, run the following code snippet:

```php
require_once("/path/to/lib/Rudder.php");

Rudder::init(WRITE_KEY, array(
  "data_plane_url" => DATA_PLANE_URL,
  "consumer"       => "lib_curl", // fork_curl
  "debug"          => true,
  "max_queue_size" => 10000,
  "batch_size"     => 100,
  "ssl"            => true // defaults to true
));
```
<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack accepts the <code class="inline-code">DATA_PLANE_URL</code> with or without the protocol. If the protocol is missing, RudderStack automatically prepends it to the URL depending on whether the <code class="inline-code">ssl</code> option is set to <code class="inline-code">true</code> or <code class="inline-code">false</code>.
</div>

<div class="warningBlock">

While initializing the RudderStack client, the <code class="inline-code">ssl</code> field is optional if you are using the HTTPS protocol. If included, its value must be set to <code class="inline-code">true</code>. 

In case of the HTTP protocol, <code class="inline-code">ssl</code> is a required field and must always be set to <code class="inline-code">false</code>.
</div>

RudderStack accepts the following data plane URL formats:

| **Protocol** | **Accepted Format**             |
| :----------- | :------------------------------ |
| `https`      | `https://example.dataplane.com` |
| `https`      | `example.dataplane.com`         |
| `http`       | `http://example.dataplane.com`  |
| `http`       | `example.dataplane.com`         |

## Sending Events from RudderStack

Once the RudderStack client is initialized, you can use it to send relevant customer events from the RudderStack client. An example `track` call is as shown in the following code snippet:

```php
Rudder::track(array(
  "userId" => "f4ca124298",
  "event" => "Signed Up",
  "properties" => array(
    "plan" => "Enterprise"
  )
));
```

## Identify

The `identify` call lets you associate a user to their actions as well as captures the relevant traits or properties related to that user.

<div class="infoBlock">
