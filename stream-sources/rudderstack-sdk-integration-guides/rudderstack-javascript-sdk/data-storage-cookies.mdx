# Data Storage in Cookies

RudderStack's JavaScript SDK stores persistent user data in cookies by default. In case the cookies are not supported, local storage is considered. 

All the cookies are stored in the top-level domain by default. It helps to identify the users visiting from websites that are hosted under a sub-domain. For example, if you include the RudderStack JavaScript SDK in both `admin.samplewebsite.com` and `app.samplewebsite.com`, the SDK will store the cookie in `samplewebsite.com`. However, you can configure the domain where you want to store the cookie by using the `setCookieDomain` parameter in the `load` API options as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.load(<WRITE_KEY>, <DATA_PLANE_URL>, {
  setCookieDomain: "samplewebsite.com",
});
```

## Cookies

The list of cookies used by JavaScript SDK can be observed below:

| Name             | Description       | Example    | Clearing Mechanism  |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |:---------------------------------- |
|  `rl_user_id`         |Stores the user ID set via the identify API method. All the subsequent event payloads would contain this data unless overridden. | `4578`, `USER_001` | `rudderanalytics.reset()`  |
|  `rl_trait`       | Stores the user traits object set via the identify API method. All the subsequent event payloads would contain this data unless overridden. |  <pre>{<br>  email: "alex@example.com",<br>  accountType: "pro",<br>  country: "US",<br>  someObj: {<br>    key1: val1,<br>    key2: val2,<br>  }<br> }</pre>         |`rudderanalytics.reset()` |
|  `rl_anonymous_id`          | Stores the anonymous ID. By default, it would the SDK auto-generated unique ID for each visitor unless overridden via setAnonymousId API method. All the subsequent event payloads would contain this data unless overridden. | `5bfe258f-bd2f-49cf-bddd-8b844f74ab4b`, `customAnonId`  | `rudderanalytics.reset(true)` |
|  `rl_group_id`          | Stores the user group ID set via the group API method.        | `GRP_3`, `98` | `rudderanalytics.reset()` |
|  `rl_group_trait`    | Stores the user group traits object set via the group API method.   |    <pre>{<br>  location: "New Orleans",<br>  nationality: "US",<br>  someObj: {<br>    key1: val1,<br>    key2: val2,<br>  }<br> }</pre>                      |  `rudderanalytics.reset()` |
| `rl_page_init_referrer`        | Stores the initial referrer of the page when a user visits the site for the first time. All the subsequent event payloads would contain this data.    | https://www.google.com/ | Cannot be cleared via SDK.|
| `rl_page_init_referring_domain`      | Stores the initial referring domain of the page when a user visits the site for the first time. All the subsequent event payloads would contain this data.  |  google.com |Cannot be cleared via SDK.|

<div class="infoBlock">

The cookie values are encrypted and their length is directly proportional to the values provided to the SDK. Also, all the cookie names are prefixed with <code class="inline-code">rl_</code> and the values are prefixed with <code class="inline-code">RudderEncrypt:</code>. For example, <code class="inline-code">rl_user_id —> RudderEncrypt:U2FsdGVkX1+UKmiooYoGmKdNws7sgmWgGfHe</code>.
</div>


## Local storage cookies

The local storage cookies are used by the JavaScript SDK to keep track of sending the events to the RudderStack backend. These can be observed as below:

| Name             | Description       | Example    |
| :------------- |:---------- | :----------- | 
|  `ack`     | A timer for any other browser tabs to claim control of the retry queue     | `1639734070124` |
|  `reclaimStart`      |To determine if a tab takes over the queue from another tab  | `2dc2aee6-2836-4273-be69-79c90c04ddec`  |
|  `reclaimEnd`     | To determine if a tab takes over the queue from another tab   | `2dc2aee6-2836-4273-be69-79c90c04ddec` |
|  `inProgress`    | To keep track of the events in progress | <pre>{<br>  "d89d7fb5-945e-4378-bda5-492e4b596fb4": {<br>  “item”: {<br>  "url": "https://rudderstack-dataplane.rudderstack.com/v1/track",<br>   "headers": {<br>  "Content-Type": "application/json",<br>  ...<br> },<br> “message”: { ...<br> }<br>  "attemptNumber": 1,<br>  "time": 1639734792773,<br> "id": "a4d89d7f-b594-4eb3-b8bd-a5492e4b596f"<br> }<br>  }<br> }<br></pre> |
|  `queue`    | To keep track of the events that are in queue to be processed   | <pre>[<br>  {<br>  “item”: {<br>  "url": "https://rudderstack-dataplane.rudderstack.com/v1/track",<br>   "headers": {<br>  "Content-Type": "application/json",<br>  ...<br> },<br> “message”: { ...<br> }<br>  "attemptNumber": 0,<br>  "time": 1639734792773,<br> "id": "a4d89d7f-b594-4eb3-b8bd-a5492e4b596f"<br> }<br> ]<br></pre> |

<div class="infoBlock">

All the local storage cookie names are prefixed with <strong>rudder.&lt;uuid&gt;.</strong> For example,
<code class="inline-code">rudder.2dc2aee6-2836-4273-be69-79c90c04ddec.reclaimEnd</code>.
