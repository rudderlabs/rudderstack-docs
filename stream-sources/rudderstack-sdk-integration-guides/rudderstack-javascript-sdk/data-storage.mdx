# Data Storage

RudderStack JavaScript SDK, by default, stores persistent user data in cookies (if cookie support is not available, then local storage is preferred).

By default, all the cookies are stored on the top-level domain. This approach helps in identifying the users from other sites that are hosted under a sub-domain.

For example, if you include the RudderStack JavaScript SDK in both [admin.samplewebsite.com](http://admin.samplewebsite.com/) and [app.samplewebsite.com](http://app.samplewebsite.com/), the SDK will store the cookie in the top-level domain [samplewebsite.com](http://samplewebsite.com/).

However, you can configure the domain via the `setCookieDomain` parameter in the `load` API options.

```javascript
rudderanalytics.load(<WRITE_KEY>, <DATA_PLANE_URL>, {
  setCookieDomain: "samplewebsite.com",
});
```
Below is a detailed description of all the user data stored by the SDK in cookies.

### Notes

1. All the cookie names are prefixed with **rl_** and the values are prefixed with **RudderEncrypt:**
2. All the cookie values are stored as encrypted, and the data length is directly proportional to the values provided to the SDK.*

## List of cookies set by the SDK



It includes the following details:

| Name             | Description       | Example    | Clearing Mechanism  |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :-------------------------------- |:---------------------------------- |
|  `rl_user_id`         |Stores the user ID set via the identify API method. All the subsequent event payloads would contain this data unless overridden. | "4578", "USER_001" etc.   | `rudderanalytics.reset()`  |
|  `rl_trait`       | Stores the user traits object set via the identify API method. All the subsequent event payloads would contain this data unless overridden. |                   |`rudderanalytics.reset()` |
|  `rl_anonymous_id`          | Stores the anonymous ID. By default, it would the SDK auto-generated unique ID for each visitor unless overridden via setAnonymousId API method. All the subsequent event payloads would contain this data unless overridden. | `rudderanalytics.reset(true)`  |
|  `rl_group_id`          | Stores the user group ID set via the group API method.        |        | `rudderanalytics.reset()` |
|  `rl_group_trait`    | Stores the user group traits object set via the group API method.   |                          |  `rudderanalytics.reset()` |
| `rl_page_init_referrer`        | Stores the initial referrer of the page when a user visits the site for the first time. All the subsequent event payloads would contain this data.    | | Cannot be cleared via SDK.|
| `rl_page_init_referring_domain`      | Stores the initial referring domain of the page when a user visits the site for the first time. All the subsequent event payloads would contain this data.  |   |Cannot be cleared via SDK.|


## List of local storage cookies set by the SDK

These are used by the SDK to keep track of sending the events to the RudderStack backend.

| Name             | Description       | Example    |
| :------------- |:---------- | :----------- | 
|  `ack`     | A timer for any other browser tabs to claim control of the retry queue     | |
|  `reclaimStart`      |To determine if a tab takes over the queue from another tab  |   |
|  `reclaimEnd`     | To determine if a tab takes over the queue from another tab   | |
|  `inProgress`    | To keep track of the events in progress | |
|  `queue`    | To keep track of the events that are in queue to be processed   | |


### Notes

1. All the above local storage cookie names are prefixed with “`rudder.<uuid>.`".
    
    Example:
    
    `rudder.2dc2aee6-2836-4273-be69-79c90c04ddec.reclaimEnd`
