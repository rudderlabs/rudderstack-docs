# JavaScript

RudderStack's JavaScript SDK leverages the `rudder-analytics.js` library to track your customer event data from your websites and send it to your specified destinations via RudderStack.

<div class="successBlock">

  Refer to the JavaScript SDK's <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-js">GitHub repository</a> for the source code and implementation details.
</div>

## Installing the SDK

To quickly set up and start using the RudderStack JavaScript SDK, go through our [**quick start guide**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/quick-start-guide).

## Supported APIs

The JavaScript SDK makes it very easy for you to send your event data to any destination without implementing a new API every time.

The following sections detail all the API calls supported by RudderStack for this SDK.

## Load

The `load` method loads the `rudder-analytics.js` file with the source write key. It is defined as follows:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, [options]);
```

<div class="infoBlock">

You need to replace the <code class="inline-code">WRITE_KEY</code> with the source write key in the RudderStack dashboard and <code class="inline-code">DATA_PLANE_URL</code> with your data plane URL.
</div>

### Write key and data plane URL

To integrate and initialize the JavaScript SDK, you need the source write key and the data plane URL.

* To get the source write key, follow [**this guide**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/get-started/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack/sending-test-events#get-the-source-write-key).

* To get the data plane URL, follow [**this guide**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/get-started/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack#what-is-a-data-plane-url-where-do-i-get-it).

### The `options` parameter

The `options` parameter in the above `load` call looks like the following:

```javascript
{
  logLevel: "DEBUG" | "INFO" | "WARN",
  integrations: IntegrationOpts,
  configUrl: string,  // defaults to https://api.rudderlabs.com
  queueOptions: QueueOpts,
  loadIntegration: boolean // defaults to true.
  secureCookie: boolean // defaults to false.
  useBeacon: boolean // defaults to false.
  beaconQueueOptions: BeaconQueueOpts
}
```

It includes the following details:

| Parameter             | Type                                | Description                                              |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
|  `logLevel`           | String                              | Options include `DEBUG`, `INFO`, and `WARN`.             |
|  `integrations`       | [**IntegrationOpts**](#integrationopts) | Refer to the [`IntegrationOpts`](#integrationopts) section. More information on how to use this parameter can be found [**here**](#filtering-selective-destinations).                                               |
|  `configUrl`          | String                              | Defaults to `https://api.rudderlabs.com`. You need to provide the server (Control Plane) endpoint serving your destination configurations. Note that `sourceConfig` is automatically appended to this endpoint by the SDK. |
|  `queueOpts`          | [**QueueOpts**](#queueopts)         | Refer to the [`QueueOpts`](#queueopts) section.          |
|  `loadIntegration`    | Boolean                             | Defaults to `true`. If set to `false`, the destination SDKs are not fetched by the SDK. This is supported for **Amplitude** and **Google Analytics**.                                                                    |
| `secureCookie`        | Boolean                             | Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, the SDK sends the cookie to the storage backend via HTTPS.|
| `useBeacon`           | Boolean                             | Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, the SDK sends the event payloads via the  `navigator.sendBeacon()` utility. |
| `beaconQueueOptions`  | [**BeaconQueueOpts**](#beaconqueueopts) | Refer to the [**BeaconQueueOpts**](#beaconqueueopts) section. |

For more details, refer to the [**`options`**](#options) parameter section.

#### The useBeacon option

As mentioned in the above table above, the JavaScript SDK supports a new Boolean field, `useBeacon`, in the `load()` call options. When set to `true`, the SDK sends events using the [**navigator.sendBeacon**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/javascript-sdk-enhancements/#sendbeacon-as-a-transport-mechanism) browser utility, which asynchronously sends a small amount of data over HTTP to the RudderStack server.

<div class="infoBlock">

The Beacon queue maintained by the browsers has a limitation on the total size of the elements present in the queue at any point and <strong>peaks at 64 KB</strong>.
</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

The RudderStack JavaScript SDK internally uses one queue to hold the data and send it in batches. Refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/#beaconqueuopts">BeaconQueueOpts</a> section below for more information.
</div>


### Loading the SDK for self-hosted control plane

If you are self-hosting the control plane using the [**RudderStack Control Plane Lite**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/get-started/control-plane-lite#what-is-the-control-plane-url) utility, your `load` call will look like the following:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.load(<WRITE_KEY>, <DATA_PLANE_URL>, {
  configUrl: <CONTROL_PLANE_URL>,
});
```

<div class="infoBlock">

  More information on how to get the <code class="inline-code">CONTROL_PLANE_URL</code> can be found <a href="https://docs.rudderstack.com/get-started/control-plane-lite/#what-is-the-control-plane-url">here</a>.
</div>

### Loading selective destinations

RudderStack lets you send your event data to selective destinations specified by you and disable sending events to the rest of the destinations. You can specify these destinations through the `load` call, as shown in the following snippet:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.load(<WRITE_KEY>, <DATA_PLANE_URL>, {
  integrations: { All: false, destination_name: true },
});
```

For more information, check the [**Filtering selective destinations**](#filtering-selective-destinations) section.

## Identify

The `identify` method allows you to link the users and their actions to a specific `userid`. You can also add additional information as `traits` to a user. Once the `identify` call is made, the SDK persists the user information and passes it to the subsequent [**`track`**](#track) or [**`page`**](#page) calls.

To reset the user identification, you can use the [**`reset`**](#reset) method.

The SDK defines the `identify` method as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify(userId, [traits], [options], [callback]);
```

The `identify` method has the following parameters:

|  Parameter     |Type        | Presence | Description                                                                                |
| :------------- |:---------- | :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  `userId`      | String     | Optional     | This string defines the user's ID in your database. If provided, this argument will be sent to destinations as the user ID instead of an `anonymousId`.                                                                                                  |
|  `traits`      | Dictionary | Optional     | This dictionary contains the traits or properties associated with a `userId` such as email, address, etc. More information on the `identify` traits can be found [**here**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/identify/#identify-traits).                                                                                                                              |
|  `options`     | Dictionary | Optional     | This dictionary provides information such as context, integrations, and `anonymousId`. Specific user traits can be provided as the context as well. Refer to the [`options`](#options) section for more information.                                     |
|  `callback`    | Function   | Optional     | This function gets executed after successful execution of the **`identify()`** method. |

A sample `identify` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify(
  "userId",
  { email: "name@domain.com" },
  {
    page: {
      path: "",
      referrer: "",
      search: "",
      title: "",
      url: ""
    }
  },
  () => {
    console.log("Sample identify call");
  }
);
```

In the above example, information such as the `userId` and `email` along with the [**contextual information**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/common-fields/#javascript-sdk) is captured.

<div class="warningBlock">

If you explicitly specify the IP address in the event, RudderStack will use that address instead of capturing it in the backend. You can use this feature to anonymize your users' IP - e.g., by supplying an anonymous IP address.
</div>

### anonymousId

The `anonymousId` is a **UUID** (Universally Unique Identifier) generated to uniquely identify the user.


<div class="infoBlock">

If the <code class="inline-code">anonymousId</code> is provided by the user using the <code class="inline-code">setAnonymousId</code> method, the user-specified <code class="inline-code">anonymousId</code> overrides the one generated by the SDK.
</div>

For more information on the `setAnonymousId` method, refer to the [**Overriding the `anonymousId` using `setAnonymousId`**](#overriding-the-anonymousId-using-setAnonymousId) section below.

<div class="infoBlock">

You don't have to call <code class="inline-code">identify</code> for the anonymous visitors to your website. Such visitors are automatically assigned an `anonymousId`.
</div>

#### How RudderStack uses anonymousId

The JavaScript SDK generates a unique `anonymousId`, stores it in a cookie named `rl_anonymous_id` in the top-level domain, and attaches to every subsequent event. This helps RudderStack in identifying the unknown users from other sites that are hosted under a sub-domain.

<div class="infoBlock">

If you identify a user with your application's unique identifier like email, database ID etc. RudderStack stores this ID in a cookie named <code class="inline-code">rl_user_id</code> and attaches to every event.
</div>

For example, if you include the RudderStack JavaScript SDK in both `admin.samplewebsite.com` and `app.samplewebsite.com`, the SDK will store the cookie in the top-level domain `samplewebsite.com`.

There are two options that you can use to identify anonymous users with the JavaScript SDK:

#### Overriding `anonymousId` in the `options` parameter

There can be scenarios where you may want to provide your own `anonymousId` instead of an SDK-generated ID. To do so, you can provide the `anonymousId` in the `options` parameter of the `identify` call, as mentioned above. This will send the value provided by you in the `anonymousId` key of the event.

<div class="infoBlock">

  Note that all other events will have the <code class="inline-code">anonymousId</code> from the one persisted in the cookie, except this event where you override the options.
</div>

An example of this approach is as shown in the code snippet below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify(
  "12345",
  { email: "name@domain.com" },
  {
    anonymousId: "my-anonymous-id"
  },
  () => {
    console.log("in identify call");
  }
);
```

#### Overriding the `anonymousId` using `setAnonymousId`

You can also override the `anonymousId` for all the future events using the `setAnonymousId()` method.

An example of this is shown in the following snippet:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.setAnonymousId("my-anonymous-id");

// All event payloads will have the anonymousId key set "my-anonymous-id".
rudderanalytics.identify("userId", { email1: "name@domain.com" }, () => {
  console.log("in identify call");
});
```

#### Using AMP Analytics

You can also parse the AMP Linker ID and set the `anonymousId`, as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.setAnonymousId(
  null,
  "<version>*<checkSum>*<idName1>*<idValue1>*<idName2>*<idValue2>..."
);
```

Here, the second parameter is the AMP Linker ID format in accordance with the [**specified structure**](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-analytics/linker-id-receiving.md#format). For the links decorated with the [**RudderStack Linker parameter**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/amp-analytics/#amp-linker), the `<idName1>` value will be `rs_amp_id`.

Calling the above method will parse the Linker ID and set the `anonymousId` as the value of the `rs_amp_id` key.

### Setting a blank `userId`

If you would like to set a blank `userid`, pass an empty string or `" "`.

<div class="warningBlock">

  Do not identify with <code class="inline-code">null</code>, as this will not allow you to pass a traits object and it will keep the current <code class="inline-code">userId</code>.
</div>

#### Use-case

Suppose an anonymous user is identified with a `userid` and then logs out of their account. You can then `identify("", {isLoggedIn: false})` and the user will continue to be identified by their `anonymousId` for future events.

### Identifying new users

To identify new users in scenarios like new logins, you can take one of the following two approaches:

#### Calling the `identify` API with a new `userid`

In this case, RudderStack will reset all the cookies related to the user associated with the `userid` and `traits` and update them with the new values provided by you.

<div class="infoBlock">

  The <code class="inline-code">anonymousId</code> will remain unchanged in this case. It will be the value that you set explicitly using `<code class="inline-code">setAnonymousId</code>, or the auto-generated value set by the SDK while loading.
</div>

#### Explicitly calling `reset` followed by `identify`

This approach has the exactly same outcome as described in the first approach.

### Updating user traits

For updating the user traits, you can call `identify` with the same `userId` multiple times with the new traits. This results in all the traits associated with that user getting appended or modified. An example is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("userId", { email1: "name@domain.com" }, () => {
  console.log("in identify call");
});

rudderanalytics.identify("userId", { email2: "name@domain.com" }, () => {
  console.log("in identify call");
});
```

In the above example, both `email1` and `email2` will be sent in the payload for the second `identify` call.

<div class="infoBlock">

  Calling <code class="inline-code">reset()</code> will reset the earlier traits, while identifying a <code class="inline-code">userId</code> with the new traits will update it with the new values.
</div>

## Page

The `page` call lets you record your website's page views with any additional relevant information about the viewed page.

<div class="infoBlock">

  Many destinations require the <code class="inline-code">page</code> events to be called at least once every page load.
</div>

The `page()` method is defined as follows:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page(category, name, [properties], [options], [callback]);
```

The `page` method has the following parameters:

| **Parameter**    | **Type**   | **Presence** | **Description**                                                                    |
| :--------------- |:-----------| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `category`       |String      | Optional     | Defines the page category.                                                         |
| `name`           | String     | Optional     | Defines the name of the page.                                                      |
| `properties`     | Dictionary | Optional     | Defines the properties of the page. These properties are auto-captured by the SDK. |
| `options`        | Dictionary | Optional     | Provides information such as context, integrations, `anonymousId`, etc. Specific user traits can also be provided as the context. Refer to the [**`options`**](#options) section for more information.                                       |
| `callback`       | Function   |Optional     | Called after the successful execution of the **`page()`** method.                   |

A sample `page()` call is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page(
  "Cart",
  "Cart Viewed",
  {
    path: "",
    referrer: "",
    search: "",
    title: "",
    url: ""
  },
  () => {
    console.log("in page call");
  }
);
```

In the above example, the SDK also captures the information such as the page category and page name along with the [**contextual information**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/common-fields/#javascript-sdk).

## Track

The `track` call lets you record the customer events, i.e. the actions that they perform, along with any properties associated with those actions.

The SDK defines the `track()` method as follows:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(event, [properties], [options], [callback]);
```

The `track` method has the following parameters:

| **Parameter**    | **Type**   | **Presence** | **Description**                                               |
| :--------------- |:-----------| :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `event`          | String     | Required     | Captures the name of the tracked event.                       |
| `properties`     | Dictionary | Optional     | Tracks the event properties.                                  |
| `options`        | Dictionary | Optional     | Tracks the information like the context, integrations, etc. Specific user traits can also be provided as the context. Refer to the [**`options`**](#options) section for more information.                                  |
| `callback`       | Function   | Optional     | Called after the successful execution of the **`track`** call.|

A sample `track` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(
  "test track event GA3",
  {
    revenue: 30,
    currency: "USD",
    user_actual_id: 12345
  },
  () => {
    console.log("in track call");
  }
);
```

In the above example, the method tracks the event `test track event GA3` along information like the `revenue`, `currency`, and the user ID.

## Alias

Many destination platforms need an explicit `alias` call for mapping the already identified users to a new identifier that you may want to use, to track them in the future. The `alias` call lets you implement this functionality.

The SDK defines the `alias()` method as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.alias(to, from, [options], [callback]);
```

The `alias` call has the following parameters:

| **Parameter**  |**Type** | **Presence** | **Description** |
| :------------- |:--------| :----------- | :---------------|
| `to`        | String     | Required     | Denotes the new identifier of the user. |
| `from`      | String     | Optional     | Denotes the old identifier which will be an alias for the `to` parameter. If not provided, the SDK will populate this as the currently identified `userId`, or `anonymousId` in case of anonymous users. |
| `options`  | Dictionary  | Optional     | A dictionary of information such as context, integrations, etc. Specific user traits can be provided as the context as well. Refer to the [**`options`**](#options) section for more information.                             |
| `callback` | Function    | Optional     | This function gets executed after the successful execution of the **`alias()`** method. |

A sample `alias()` method is shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.alias("test_new_id", "old_user_id", () => {
  console.log("alias call");
});
```

## Group

The `group` call lets you link an identified user with a group such as a company, organization, or an account. It also lets you record any custom traits associated with that group such as the name of the company, the number of employees, etc.

The `group()` method is defined as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.group(groupId, [traits], [options], [callback]);
```

The `group` method has the following parameters:

| **Parameter**  |**Type** | **Presence** | **Description** |
| :------------- |:--------| :----------- | :-------------- |
| `groupId`  |String | Required     | Denotes the group identifier to which the traits are to be modified or added. RudderStack will call the destination APIs to attach the currently identified user to this group.|
| `traits`   | Dictionary | Optional     | Denotes the group traits. RudderStack will pass these traits to the destination to enhance the group properties.|
| `options`  | Dictionary | Optional     | A dictionary of information such as context, integrations, etc. Specific user traits can be provided as the context as well. Refer to the [**`options`**](#options) section for more information.   |
| `callback` | Function | Optional     | Gets executed after the successful execution of the `group()` method.|

A sample `group()` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.group("sample_group_id", {
  name: "CompanyA",
  location: "USA",
});
```

## Reset

The `reset` method resets the `userId` and the associated user traits and properties.

The following snippet shows an example of the `reset()` method:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.reset();
```

<div class="warningBlock">
  
The <code class="inline-code">reset()</code> method only clears the cookies and local storage set by RudderStack. It does not clear the information stored by the integrated destinations. To completely clear the user session, refer to the destination-specific documentation.
</div>

## Parameter definitions

This section details the type definitions of the parameters used in some of the API methods described above:

### `options`

The structure of **`options`** parameter is as shown:

```javascript
{
  integrations: IntegrationOpts,
  anonymousId: string,
  originalTimestamp: ISO 8601 date string,
  <other keys>: <value> // merged with event's contextual information
}
```
The following table describes each of the above parameters in detail:

| **Parameter**                   | **Type**                                | **Description**  |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| `integrations`         | [**IntegrationOpts**](#integrationopts) | Refer to the [`IntegrationOpts`](#integrationopts) section. More information on how to use this parameter can be found [**here**](#filtering-selective-destinations). |
| `anonymousId`           | String                              | Overrides the current event's `anonymousId` at the top level. |
| `originalTimestamp`     | ISO 8601 Date string                | Overrides the current event's `originalTimestamp` at the top level. |
| `<other keys>: <value>` | -                                   | Merged with the event's contextual information. |

### `IntegrationOpts`

The structure of **`IntegrationOpts`** looks like the following:

```javascript
{
  All: boolean, // default true
  <Destination1>: boolean,
  <Destination2>: boolean,
  ...
}
```

The following table describes each of the above parameters in detail:

| **Parameter**       | **Type**| **Presence**  | **Description**  |
| :------------------ | :------ |:--------------| :----------------------- |
| `All`               | Boolean | Optional      | Corresponds to all the destinations to which the event is to be sent. The default value is set to `true`. `All: false` will lead to RudderStack not sending the event data to any destination. |
| `<Destination>`     | Boolean | Optional      | Specific destination to which the event is to be sent or not sent, depending on the Boolean value assigned to it. |

More information on using `IntegrationOpts` can be found in the [**Filtering selective destinations**](#filtering-selective-destinations) section.

### `QueueOpts`

The structure of **`QueueOpts`** is shown below:

```javascript
{
  maxRetryDelay: 360000,
  minRetryDelay: 1000,
  backoffFactor: 2,
  maxAttempts: 10,
  maxItems: 100,
}
```

The following table describes each of the above parameters in detail:

| **Parameter**   | **Type**| **Description**                                                      | **Default value** |
| :-------------- | :------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------|
| `maxRetryDelay` | Integer | The upper limit on the maximum delay for an event.                   | 36000ms           |
| `minRetryDelay` | Integer | The minimum delay expected before sending an event.                  | 1000ms            |
| `backoffFactor` | Integer | Refers to the exponential base.                                      | 2                 |
| `maxAttempts`   | Integer | Maximum number of attempts to send the event to the destination.     | 10                |
| `maxItems`      | Integer | Maximum number of events kept in the storage.                        |    100            |


#### `BeaconQueueOpts`

The structure of **`BeaconQueueOpts`** is shown below:

```javascript
{
  maxItems: 10 
  flushQueueInterval: 600000
}
```

| Parameter             | Type                                | Description                                                          | Default Value    |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------|
| `maxItems`            | Integer                             | The SDK flushes the queue when this number of payloads is reached.   | `10`             |
| `flushQueueInterval`  | Integer                             | The SDK flushes the queue after this time interval(in milliseconds). | `600000`         |


<div class="infoBlock">

The SDK flushes the queue if the total size of the payload exceeds 64 KB before reaching the <code class="inline-code">maxItems</code>/<code class="inline-code">flushQueueInterval</code> value in the configuration.
</div>

## Adding callbacks to standard methods

RudderStack lets you define callbacks to the common methods of the `rudderanalytics` object.

<div class="warningBlock">

  This functionality is supported only for the <code class="inline-code">syncPixel</code> method which is called in the SDK when making synchronization calls for the relevant destinations.
</div>

An example is shown below:

```javascript
<script>
rudderanalytics.syncPixelCallback = obj => {
  rudderanalytics.track(
    "sync lotame",
    {
      destination: obj.destination
    },
    {
      integrations: {
        All: false,
        S3: true
      }
    }
  );
};
</script>

<script src="https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/rudder-analytics.min.js"></script>
```

In the above example, RudderStack defines a `syncPixelCallback` on the `rudderanalytics` object loading the SDK. This will lead to RudderStack calling this registered callback with the parameter `{destination: <destination_name>}` whenever a sync call is made from the SDK to the relevant integrations, e.g. Lotame.

You can also add the callback in the `options` parameter as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.load(<WRITE_KEY>, <DATA_PLANE_URL>, {
  clientSuppliedCallbacks: {
    syncPixelCallback: () => {
      console.log("sync done!");
    },
  },
});
```

<div class="successBlock">

  We will be adding similar callbacks for other APIs such as <code class="inline-code">track</code>, <code class="inline-code">page</code>, <code class="inline-code">identify</code>, etc. very soon.
</div>

## Filtering selective destinations

RudderStack lets you load or send your event data to only the destinations specified by you. You can do so by passing an [**integrations object**](#integrationopts) in the `options` parameter of the API methods. RudderStack then loads or sends events only to those destinations that are specified and enabled.

The format of the `load` method with the integration names passed as arguments is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {
  integrations: {
    All: false,
    destination_name: true
  }
});
```
Here, `<destination_name>` is the name of the destination.

### Examples

* The format of the `track` method with the integration names passed as arguments is as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(
  "test track event GA3",
  {
    revenue: 30,
    currency: "USD",
    user_actual_id: 12345
  },
  {
    integrations: {
      All: false,
      destination_name: true
    }
  }
);
```

* The following example shows how to load only the Google Analytics and Intercom destinations:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.load(WRITE_KEY, DATA_PLANE_URL, {
  integrations: {
    All: false,
    "Google Analytics": true,
    Intercom: true
  }
});
```

* The following example highlights how you can send the `track` type of events only to Google Analytics:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(
  "test track event GA3",
  {
    revenue: 30,
    currency: "USD",
    user_actual_id: 12345
  },
  {
    integrations: {
      All: false,
      "Google Analytics": true
    }
  }
);
```

<div class="infoBlock">

You can refer to the <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/#common-destination-names">Common destination names</a> for the naming conventions for the destinations.
</div>

### Common destination names

The following table lists some of the popular destinations along with their supported names that RudderStack uses as values when sending the event data.

## Context and traits

RudderStack gives you the option to automatically capture certain event-specific and user-specific data, based on the type of the event.

In this section, we cover two specific dictionaries within the [`options`](#options) parameter included in the supported API methods.

### Context

A context is a dictionary of additional information about a particular event data, such as a user’s locale.

<div class="infoBlock">

A context is a complete and specific piece of information. Any other information provided outside of this specification is ignored.
</div>

### Traits

Traits is an optional dictionary included within [`context`](#context) which specifies the user's unique traits. This is a very useful field for linking the user's information from a previously made [`identify()`](#identify) call to the subsequent [`track()`](#track) or [`page()`](#page) calls.

#### Use-case

To better understand how contexts and traits work, refer to the following `identify` event:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.identify("userId", {
  plan: "Paid, Premium",
  email: "name@surname.org"
});
```

The trait in the above event is `plan`. If you wish to include this trait in a subsequent `track()` or `page()`event triggered by the user, you can establish the association by passing it in `context.traits` as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track(
  "Subscribed",
  {
    campaign: "Subscribe"
  },
  {
    context: {
      traits: {
        plan: "Paid, Premium"
      }
    }
  }
);
```

The above snippet will append `plan` as a trait to the `track` event. Note that the trait `email` will not be appended, as it was not specified in the `context.traits` field.
