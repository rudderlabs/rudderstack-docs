# Version Migration Guide

The **JavaScript SDK  v1.1** is a lightweight, more efficient, and optimized version of the [RudderStack JavaScript SDK](https://rudderstack.com/docs/stream-sources/rudderstack-sdk-integration-guides/rudderstack-javascript-sdk/) and offers the following features:

* The size of the SDK is reduced by approximately **70%**, considerably reducing its loading time.
* The destination SDKs are separated from the core JavaScript SDK. They are now published as individual plugins.
* The [device mode](https://rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode) destinations are loaded dynamically as per your specified dashboard configurations.

## JavaScript SDK v1 vs. v1.1

|Parameter|v1|v1.1|
|---------|--|----|
|**Size**|114 KB<sup>*</sup>|34 KB<sup>*</sup>|
|**Device mode destination SDKs**|All the device mode destination SDKs are bundled with the core SDK.|The device mode destination SDKs are dynamically loaded as per the source configuration in the dashboard.|

<div class="infoBlock">

The SDK size may vary in the future as we add more functionalities.
</div>

## Migrating to v1.1

This section covers the steps to migrate to v1.1 of the JavaScript SDK, depending on your previous installation of the JavaScript SDK (v1).

### Case 1: Loading the SDK from the RudderStack CDN

If you are loading the JavaScript SDK from RudderStack's CDN, update the script tag in your website.

For **v1**:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1/rudder-analytics.min.js" />
```

For **v1.1**:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/rudder-analytics.min.js" />
```

### Case 2: Forwarding/proxying the RudderStack CDN

If you are forwarding or proxying RudderStack's CDN, follow these steps:

1. Log into your CDN provider account.
2. Go to the distribution whose origin is set to RudderStack's CDN. Ensure that the entire domain (`https://cdn.rudderlabs.com`) is set as the origin.

<div class="infoBlock">

We highly recommend forwarding the entire CDN path <code class="inline-code">https://cdn.rudderlabs.com</code> so that you don't miss any files/directories that might be added in the future.
</div>

<div class="successBlock">

  Refer to our guide on <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/user-guides/how-to-guides/custom-domains/">using custom domains</a> for more information CDN forwarding/proxying.
</div>

3. Then, go to **Behaviors**, and check that the sub-path `/v1.1/*` is **not configured to be blocked** in any way.

<div class="warningBlock">

This step is required to ensure that both the core SDK and destination SDKs are forwarded properly.
</div>

4. Finally, update the script tag in your website as shown:

For **v1**:

```html
<script src="https://<subdomain>.<yourdomain>.com/v1/rudder-analytics.min.js" />
```

For **v1.1**:

```html
<script src="https://<subdomain>.<yourdomain>.com/v1.1/rudder-analytics.min.js" />
```

### Case 3: Self-hosting RudderStack's CDN

If you have cloned RudderStack's JavaScript SDK and are self-hosting it via your own CDN, follow the steps below:

1. Download the core [JavaScript SDK v1.1](https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/rudder-analytics.min.js).
2. Download all the destination SDKs listed [here](#rudderstack-destination-sdks).
3. Move all the downloaded files to your preferred location.

<div class="warningBlock">

The destination SDKs name should not be changed as the custom names are not supported.
</div>

We recommend maintaining the following structure:

<img src="../../../assets/js-sdk-version-migration.png" alt="Recommended structure for self-hosting RudderStack's CDN" />

4. Next, check the core SDK's filename:
- If it is different than `rudder-analytics.min.js`, update the script tag in your website as shown below:

```html
<script>
// rudderanalytics object initialization
// ...
// ...
// provide the location of the destination SDKs in the load options
rudderanalytics.load(<WRITE_KEY>, <DATA_PLANE_URL>, {
    destSDKBaseURL: "https://cdn.<yourdomain>.com/js-integrations"
});
// ...
// ...
</script>

<script src="https://cdn.<yourdomain>.com/<your-custom-analytics-file>.js"></script>
```

- If it **is** `rudder-analytics.min.js` and:
  - The destination SDKs are located next to the core SDK file under the `js-integrations` directory (as highlighted in the tip above), update the script tag as shown:

    ```html
    <script src="https://cdn.<yourdomain>.com/rudder-analytics.min.js"></script>
    ```

  - The destination SDKs are **not** located next to the core SDK file under the `js-integrations` directory, update the script tag as shown:


    ```html
    <script>
    // rudderanalytics object initialization
    // ...
    // ...
    // provide the location of the destination SDKs in the load options
    rudderanalytics.load(<WRITE_KEY>, <DATA_PLANE_URL>, {
        destSDKBaseURL: "https://cdn.<yourdomain>.com/custom-js-integrations"
    });
    // ...
    // ...
    </script>

    <script src="https://cdn.<yourdomain>.com/rudder-analytics.min.js"></script>
    ```

## Updating version using NPM

The latest NPM package is based on JavaScript SDK v1.1 architecture and is released with the 2.x.x version. To update the SDK package using NPM, use any of the below options:

* Upgrade `rudder-sdk-js` package to the latest version using the below command:

```javascript
npm install rudder-sdk-js@latest
```

* Upgrade `rudder-sdk-js` package to a specific version using the below command:

```javascript
npm install rudder-sdk-js@2.x.x
```

* Manually modify the **package.json** file like below and run `npm install`:

```javascript
"dependencies": {
  "rudder-sdk-js": "^2.x.x"
}
```
### Load device mode destinations

The device mode destinations are loaded from https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/js-integrations/ in 2.x.x, depending on the dashboard settings. This path can be used **for proxy** as well and should **not be configured to be blocked** in any way. 

If you want to load the device-mode destinations from a different path, follow the below steps: 

1. Download the destination SDKs listed [here](#rudderstack-destination-sdks).
2. Move all the downloaded files to your preferred location.
3. Use `destSDKBaseURL` option in the load call the like below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.load( <WRITE_KEY> , <DATA_PLANE_URL> , {
  destSDKBaseURL: "<your-custom-path-for-device-mode-destination>", // ex: "https://cdn.<yourdomain>.com/js-integrations"
  ...otherOptions
});
```

<div class="warningBlock">
The destination SDKs name should not be changed as the custom names are not supported.
</div>

## FAQ

### How are the destination SDKs loaded in v1.1?

In v1.1, the core JavaScript SDK does not contain any destination-specific SDKs by default. Depending on the device mode destinations configured in your dashboard (control plane), the necessary SDKs are dynamically fetched from the hosted location.

The hosted location can be either of:

* RudderStack's CDN
* Your CDN that proxies the RudderStack CDN, or
* A self-hosted domain

Refer to the **Migrating to v1.1** section above for more details.

### How does RudderStack determine the destination SDKs' root location?

RudderStack follows the below precedence order while determining the root location of the destination SDKs:

1. RudderStack refers to the `destSDKBaseURL` value in the `options` parameter of the `load` API call.
2. If absent, RudderStack then checks the `src` attribute of the `<script>` tag that adds the core JavaScript SDK to your website. `/js-integrations` is automatically appended to the root location.
3. If none of the two options above are applicable, RudderStack uses the default CDN URL ([**https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/js-integrations/**](https://cdn.rudderlabs.com/v1.1/js-integrations/)).

The above approach ensures that minimal changes are required from your end.
