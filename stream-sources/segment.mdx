# Segment

[Segment](https://segment.com) is a Customer Data Platform \(CDP\) that allows you to collect your customer data, while giving you complete control over how you use it. It is a popular tool that is used by many businesses to collect and send event data to various platforms, including but not limited to - Zendesk, Optimizely, and Google Analytics. Segment is a good option for companies that are sending data to several databases, and integrating with lots of different marketing tools.

This guide is aimed at setting up Segment as a source in RudderStack in the easiest possible way. You can simply add a webhook destination in your Segment dashboard that points to RudderStack. This way, you can send events to RudderStack whenever Segment gets an event.

## Getting Started

In order to add Segment as a source in RudderStack, please follow these steps:

- From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com), click on **Add Source**. From the list of sources, select **Segment**, as shown:

<img src="../../../images/assets/segment1.png" />
<span class="imageTitle">Segment Source</span>

- Enter the name you want to assign to this source.
- Once you have entered the name of your source, click on **Next** and save the source.
- Head over to your [Segment Dashboard](https://app.segment.com/workspaces) and navigate to the **Destinations** page from the sidebar. Click on **Add Destination** and on the destination catalog page search for the destination **Webhooks**, as shown in the screenshot below:

<img src="../../../images/assets/segment2.png" />
<span class="imageTitle">Segment Webhook destination</span>

- Now configure the destination and connect it to your desired source. On the destination settings screen, enter the RudderStack webhook. The following screenshot shows where to put the **Webhook URL:**

<img src="../../../images/assets/segment3.png" />
<span class="imageTitle">Segment Webhook Destination settings</span>

Your webhook URL should follow this format `<your-dataplane-url>/v1/webhook?writeKey=<segment-source-writeKey>`

An example webhook URL is as follows:

```bash
https://some.dataplaneurl.com/v1/webhook?writeKey=1bCenS7ynqHh8ETX8s5Crjh22J
```

<div class="warningBlock">

Make sure you add the <code class="inline-code">writeKey</code> as a query parameter to the URL. This is required to prevent the webhook from failing for the lack of a valid write key.

</div>

## RudderStack Event Transformation

Being Segment API compatible, RudderStack does not perform any modifications on the data sent by Segment.
