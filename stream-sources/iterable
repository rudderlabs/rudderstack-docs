# Iterable

[Iterable](https://iterable.com/) is an industry-leading mobile attribution and marketing analytics platform, provided as a Software-as-a-Service \(SaaS\). It offers exciting features to understand your customers better through intuitive dashboards, real-time data reports, and a unique deep linking technology.

You can send your AppsFlyer events to RudderStack by adding an endpoint that points to RudderStack, with AppsFlyer's **Push API** option. This way, you can capture all the relevant AppsFlyer events related to re-engagement, reattribution, in-app install events, etc. and send them to RudderStack.

This guide will help you set up Iterable as a source in RudderStack.

## Getting started

Follow these steps to set up your Iterable source in the RudderStack dashboard:

- Go to your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/) and click on **Add Source**. Then, select **Iterable** from the list of **Event Stream** sources, as shown:

- Assign a name to your source and click on **Next**.

- Your Iterable source is now configured. Note the source **Write key** - this will be required to configure the endpoint URL in the later steps.

- Head over to your Iterable account and navigate to the **API Access** section under **Integration** from the sidebar. Look for the **Push API** section, as shown:

- Add the **Endpoint URL** pointing to RudderStack in the following format:

`<DATA_PLANE_URL>/v1/webhook?writeKey=<WRITE_KEY>`

<div class="infoBlock">

For more information on the data plane URL, refer to <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-open-source/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack/#what-is-a-data-plane-url-where-do-i-get-it">this</a> section.
</div>

<div class="warningBlock">

Make sure you add the source write key as query parameter to the URL. This is required to prevent the webhook from failing because of an invalid write key.
</div>

A sample endpoint URL is shown below:

```http
https://hosted.rudderlabs.com/v1/webhook?writeKey=1bCenS7ynqHh8ETX8s5Crjh22J
```

<div class="infoBlock">

We highly recommend validating the endpoint using the **Send Test** button.
</div>

- Finally, save the endpoint.

## Event transformation

The AppsFlyer Push events are ingested into RudderStack after converting them into the RudderStack event format. For example, RudderStack converts the `customer_user_id` property set by AppsFlyer into `userId`.

RudderStack populates the following properties from AppsFlyer event payload into the RudderStack event:

| AppsFlyer Property  | RudderStack Property                                       |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
