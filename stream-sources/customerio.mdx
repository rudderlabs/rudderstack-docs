# Customer.io

[Customer.io](https://customer.io/) is a popular marketing platform for sending targeted emails and push and SMS notifications to improve customer engagement and thereby the overall conversion rate. It leverages real-time behavioral data and advanced segmentation techniques across the web and mobile platforms to improve your customers' overall experience.

This document guides you in setting up Customer.io as a source in RudderStack. By adding a reporting webhook in Customer.io that points to RudderStack, you can send events to RudderStack whenever Customer.io sends messages to your customers. Events such as messages delivered, opened, and clicked by the customers are also captured and sent to RudderStack.

## Getting Started

In order to add Customer.io as a source in RudderStack, please follow these steps:

- From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderlabs.com/), click on **Add Source**. From the list of sources, select **Customer.io**, as shown:

<img src="../assets/image (20) (1).png" />

- Enter the name of your source.

<div class="infoBlock">

If you wish to connect this source to our warehouse destinations, the source name should match the name of your warehouse schema.

</div>

- Once you have entered the name of your source, click on **Next** and save the source.

- Head over to your Customer.io account and navigate to the **Integrations** page from the sidebar. Look for the integration **Reporting Webhooks**, as shown:

<img src="../assets/image (62).png" />

- Click on **Add Webhook** and add a webhook pointing to the URL in the following format:`<your_dataplane_url>/v1/webhook?writeKey=<your_customer_io_source_write_key>`

An example URL would like the following:

```http
https://hosted.rudderlabs.com/v1/webhook?writeKey=1bCenS7ynqHh8ETX8s5Crjh22J
```

<div class="warningBlock">
Make sure to add the <code class="inline-code">writeKey</code> as query parameter to the URL. This is required to prevent the webhook from failing for the lack of a valid write key.

</div>

A sample figure highlighting this step is as shown:

- Finally, save the webhook.

## RudderStack Event Transformation

The webhook event from Customer.io is ingested into RudderStack after converting it into the format of a RudderStack event. The `customer_id` set by Customer.io is set as `userId` . In cases where Customer.io does not send the `customer_id`, the email address of the user is set as `anonymousId`.
