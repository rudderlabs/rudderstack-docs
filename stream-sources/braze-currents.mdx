# Braze

[**Braze**](https://www.braze.com/) is an industry-leading customer engagement platform. It provides a cross-channel, data-driven platform to help you better understand your customers' in-app behavior, use the insights to improve your users' app experience, and increase engagement with them.

You can send your Braze events to RudderStack by leveraging [**Braze Currents**](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/data_and_analytics/braze_currents/).

This guide will help you set up Braze as a source in RudderStack.

## Getting started

- Go to your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/) and click on **Add Source**. Then, select **Braze** from the list of **Event Stream** sources, as shown:
