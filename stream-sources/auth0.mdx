# Auth0

[**Auth0**](https://auth0.com/) is a popular solution used by many companies to add authentication and authorization services to their applications. You can connect Auth0 to your application with just a few lines of code and also define the identity providers, i.e., how you want the users to log in.

This guide will help you set up Auth0 as a source in RudderStack.

## Introduction

By adding an [**Auth0 Authentication API webhook**](https://auth0.com/docs/extensions/auth0-authentication-api-webhooks) extension that points to RudderStack, you can send events to RudderStack whenever Auth0 generates an authentication log. This way, you can capture events related to logins and signups and send them to RudderStack.

## Getting Started

In order to add Auth0 as a source in RudderStack, please follow these steps:

- From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderlabs.com/), click on **Add Source**. From the list of sources, select **Auth0**.

<img src="../../../images/assets/auth02.png" /><span class="imageTitle">Auth0 Source</span>

- Enter the name you want to assign to this source.
- Once you have entered the name of your source, click on **Next** and save the source.
- Head over to your [**Auth0**](https://auth0.com/) account and navigate to the **Extensions** page from the sidebar.
- Look for the extension **Auth0 Authentication API webhooks**, as shown:

<img src="../../../images/assets/auth03.png" />

- After selecting this option, you should be able to see the extension installation page as shown:

<img src="../../../images/assets/auth04.png" /><span class="imageTitle">Auth0 extension installation page</span>

- At the bottom, select the **LOG_TYPES** option for which you want to forward the events to RudderStack.

- Add the **WEBHOOK_URL** as shown on the source settings page in your RudderStack dashboard.

<img src="../../../images/assets/1 (25).png" />

The webhook URL is of the format:

```
<DATA_PLANE_URL>/v1/webhook?writeKey=<YOUR_AUTH0_SOURCE_WRITE_KEY>
```

- If you're using RudderStack Cloud, replace `<DATA_PLANE_URL>` with [**https://hosted.rudderlabs.com/**](https://hosted.rudderlabs.com/).
- If you're hosting your own Data Plane, replace `<DATA_PLANE_URL>` with your [**hosted Data Plane URL**](https://rudderstack.com/docs/get-started/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack#what-is-a-data-plane-url-where-do-i-get-it).

An example is as shown:

`https://hosted.rudderlabs.com/v1/webhook?writeKey=1bCenS7ynqHh8ETX8s5Crjh22J`

<div class="warningBlock">

Make sure you add the <code class="inline-code">writeKey</code> as the query parameter to the URL. This is required to prevent the webhook from failing for the lack of a valid write key.

</div>

Then, continue with the rest of the steps, as follows:

- Keep the authorization section as blank.
- You can disable the **SEND_AS_BATCH** setting to receive the events in separate requests. However, we recommend setting it to **Enabled**.
- Finally click on **INSTALL** to install the webhook on your Auth0 dashboard.

## RudderStack Event Transformation

The webhook event from Auth0 is ingested into RudderStack after converting it into the RudderStack event format. The `user_id` set by Auth0 is converted to `userId`.

The following table lists the properties populated from the Auth0 event payload directly to the RudderStack event:

| **Auth0 Property**        | **RudderStack Property**                                                                    |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `client_id`               | `properties.client_id`                                                                      |
| `client_name`             | `properties.client_name`                                                                    |
| `details`                 | `properties.details` **NOTE**: These are the unmodified details sent by Auth0. |
| `auth0_client`            | `properties.auth0_client`                                                                   |
| `log_id`                  | `properties.log_id`                                                                         |
| `isMobile`                | `properties.is_mobile`                                                                      |
| `description`             | `properties.description`                                                                    |
| `ip`                      | `context.request_ip`                                                                        |
| `details.auth.user.email` | `context.traits.email`                                                                      |
| `details.auth.user.name`  | `context.traits.name`                                                                       |
| `user_name`               | `context.traits.user_name`                                                                  |
| `user_agent`              | `context.userAgent`                                                                         |

## How to Debug

If you're unable to see any events flowing from the Auth0 API webhooks to RudderStack, you can troubleshoot the issue by viewing the API webhooks logs. To do so, go to your Auth0 dashboard and navigate to **Monitoring** - **Logs**.
