# AppsFlyer

[AppsFlyer](https://www.appsflyer.com/) is an industry-leading mobile attribution and marketing analytics platform, provided as a Software-as-a-Service \(SaaS\). It offers exciting features to understand your customers better through intuitive dashboards, real-time data reports, and a unique deep linking technology.

This document guides you in setting up AppsFlyer as a source in RudderStack. You can send your AppsFlyer events by simply adding an endpoint that points to RudderStack, with AppsFlyer's **Push API** option. With this integration, you can also capture and send events such as re-engagement, reattribution, in-app install events, etc. to RudderStack.

## Getting Started

In order to add AppsFlyer as a source in RudderStack, please follow these steps:

- From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), click on **Add Source**. From the list of sources, select **AppsFlyer**, as shown:

- Enter the name of your source, and click on **Next**.

- Head over to your AppsFlyer account and navigate to the **API Access** section under **Integration** from the sidebar. Look for the **Push API** section, as shown:

- Under the **Endpoint Configuration**, add an endpoint URL pointing to RudderStack in the following format:`<DATA_PLANE_URL>/v1/webhook?writeKey=<your_AppsFlyer_source_write_key>`

An example URL should like the following:

```http
https://hosted.rudderlabs.com/v1/webhook?writeKey=1bCenS7ynqHh8ETX8s5Crjh22J
```

<div class="warningBlock">

Make sure you add the <code class="inline-code">writeKey</code> as query parameter to the URL. This is required to prevent the webhook from failing for the lack of a valid write key.

</div>

<div class="infoBlock">

You can validate the endpoint using the **Send Test** button.

- Finally, save the endpoint.

## RudderStack Event Transformation

The Push events from AppsFlyer are ingested into RudderStack after converting it into the RudderStack event format. For example, the `customer_user_id` set by AppsFlyer is set as `userId` .

Also, RudderStack populates the following properties from AppsFlyer event payload to the RudderStack event:

| AppsFlyer Property  | RudderStack Property                                       |
