# Shopify

[**Shopify**](https://www.shopify.in/) is a popular all-in-one E-commerce platform that gives you all the tools to start, run, and grow your business effectively. It offers online retailers a variety of services around digital payments, marketing, product shipping, customer engagement and retention, and more.

This guide will help you set up Shopify as a source in RudderStack.

## Event transformation

The Shopify source supports both [**cloud mode**](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode) and [**device mode**](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode) tracking.

<div class="infoBlock">

For cloud mode tracking, RudderStack uses the Shopify-provided webhooks, whereas for device mode tracking, RudderStack inserts a JavaScript tracking code into every page of the respective Shopify store.
</div>

### Supported cloud mode events

- RudderStack supports and maps Shopify's `customer_create` and `customer_update` events as `identify` events.
- RudderStack also supports the `checkout_created` and `order_update` events as the [E-commerce events](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-ecommerce-events-specification/).
- The following Shopify events are mapped to RudderStack's generic `track` events:

```javascript
[
  "checkout_delete",
  "checkout_update",
  "customers_disabled",
  "customers_enable",
  "carts_create",
  "carts_update",
  "fulfillments_create",
  "fulfillments_update",
  "orders_create",
  "orders_delete",
  "orders_cancelled",
  "orders_fulfilled",
  "orders_paid",
  "orders_partially_fullfilled",
]
```

<div class="warningBlock">

Any other events flowing through RudderStack except the <code class="inline-code">track</code>, <code class="inline-code">identify</code>, and the E-commerce events mentioned above will be <strong>discarded</strong>.
</div>

### Supported device mode events

- RudderStack supports the `Page Viewed` event for every page visited on the Shopify store.
- It also supports the `Registration Viewed` as a generic `track` event whenever the user visits their account or the registration page.
- RudderStack supports the following E-commerce events in device mode:

| Event name |
| :------------|
