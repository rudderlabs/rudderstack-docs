## Event transformation

The Shopify source supports both [**cloud mode**](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/#cloud-mode) and [**device mode**](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/connections/rudderstack-connection-modes/#device-mode) tracking.

For cloud mode tracking, RudderStack uses the Shopify-provided webhooks, whereas for device mode tracking, RudderStack inserts a JavaScript tracking code into every page of the respective Shopify store.

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack enables both cloud mode and device mode tracking simultaneously.
