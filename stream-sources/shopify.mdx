# Shopify

[Shopify](https://www.shopify.in/) is a popular all-in-one E-commerce platform that gives you all the tools to start, run, and grow your business effectively. It offers online retailers a variety of services around digital payments, marketing, product shipping, customer engagement and retention, and more.

This guide will help you set up Shopify as a source in RudderStack.

<div class="infoBlock">
  
  Setting up the Shopify source involves two steps:

<ul>
  <li><a href="#configuring-the-shopify-source-in-rudderstack">Configuring the Shopify source in RudderStack</a></li>
  <li><a href="#configuring-the-rudderstack-app-in-your-shopify-store">Configuring the RudderStack app in your Shopify store</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

## Configuring the Shopify source in RudderStack

Follow these steps to set up your Shopify source in the RudderStack dashboard:

1. Go to your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/) and click on **Add Source**. From the list of **Event Stream** sources, select **Shopify**, as shown:

<img src="../assets/event-stream-sources/shopify-1.png" alt="Shopify source in RudderStack dashboard" />

2. Assign a name to your source and click on **Next**.

3. Your Shopify source is now configured. Note the source **Write key**. This will be required later while configuring the RudderStack app on your Shopify store.

<img src="../assets/event-stream-sources/shopify-2.png" alt="Shopify source webhook URL" />

4. Finally, connect the source to your desired destinations.

## Configuring the RudderStack app in your Shopify store

To complete the configuration, you will need to add and configure the RudderStack app in your Shopify store. Follow these steps:

1. Go to your Shopify store's [admin dashboard](https://accounts.shopify.com/store-login).
2. In the left sidebar, click on **Apps**. Then, click on **Customize your store**, as shown:

<img src="../assets/event-stream-sources/shopify-3.png" alt="Customizing Shopify store" />

3. Search for RudderStack, as shown:

<img src="../assets/event-stream-sources/shopify-4.png" alt="RudderStack app search" />

4. In the search results, click on the RudderStack app. Then, click on **Add app**. 

<img src="../assets/event-stream-sources/RS-Shopify-app.png" alt="Add RudderStack app" />

<div class="infoBlock">

Alternatively, you can install the RudderStack app directly using this <a href="https://apps.shopify.com/rudderstack">link</a>.
</div>

5. After installation, you should be able to see the app in the **Installed apps** section, as shown:

<img src="../assets/event-stream-sources/shopify-5.png" alt="Installed RudderStack app" />

6. Select the installed RudderStack app.
7. Enter your **RudderStack Data Plane URL** and the **Source Write Key** that you copied [**above**](#setting-up-the-shopify-source-in-rudderstack), as shown:

<img src="../assets/event-stream-sources/shopify-6.png" alt="Data plane URL and source write key" />

<div class="infoBlock">

Follow <a href="https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-open-source/installing-and-setting-up-rudderstack/#what-is-a-data-plane-url-where-do-i-get-it">this section</a> for more information on the data plane URL and where to get it.
</div>

8. Finally, click on **Submit**.

<div class="infoBlock">

  You can also update these fields later with a different write key and data plane URL.
</div>

## Event transformation

The Shopify source supports both the server and client-side tracking. RudderStack enables simultaneous tracking of user events using these.

### Tracking server-side events

<div class="infoBlock">

RudderStack uses the Shopify-provided webhooks for tracking events on the server-side. 
</div>

The following table details the supported Shopify events and their corresponding [topic](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/2022-01/resources/webhook#:~:text=a%20custom%20storefront.-,Mandatory%20webhooks,-You%20don%27t%20create) mapping for `identify` calls:

| Identify event name            | Description                 | Subscribed Shopify topic      | 
| :-----------------------------| :---------------------------| :------------------------------|
| `customers_create`            | Customer was created.        | `customers/create`            | 
| `customers_update`            | Customer was updated.        | `customers/update`            |

| Track event name            | Description                 | Subscribed Shopify topic        |  
| :-----------------------------| :---------------------------| :-----------------------------|

| `orders_create`               | Order was created.          | `orders/create`               | 
| `orders_delete`               | Order was deleted.           | `orders/delete`               |
| `orders_cancelled`            | Order was cancelled.        | `orders/cancelled`            |

RudderStack also supports the following [E-commerce events](https://rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-ecommerce-events-specification/):

| E-commerce event name          | Description                 | Subscribed Shopify topic      |
| :----------------------------- | :---------------------------| :-----------------------------|
| `Checkout Started`             | A new checkout was created. | `checkouts/create`            |
| `Order Updated`                | Order was updated.          | `orders/updated`              |

<div class="warningBlock">

Any other events flowing through RudderStack except the <code class="inline-code">track</code>, <code class="inline-code">identify</code>, and the E-commerce events mentioned above will be <strong>discarded</strong>.
</div>

#### Required scopes

### Tracking client-side events

<div class="infoBlock">

For tracking the client-side events, RudderStack inserts a JavaScript tracking code into every page of the respective Shopify store.
</div>

- RudderStack supports the [`page`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/page/) event for every page visited on the Shopify store.
- It also supports the `Registration Viewed` as a generic [`track`](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-spec/track/) event whenever the user views their account or registration page.
- The following [E-commerce events](https://www.rudderstack.com/docs/rudderstack-api/api-specification/rudderstack-ecommerce-events-specification/) are also supported on client-side:

| Event name             | Description                                |
| :----------------------| :------------------------------------------|
| `Cart Viewed`          | User viewed the cart page.                 |
| `Checkout Started`     | User clicked on the buy button.            |
| `Product Added`        | User added the product to the cart.        |
| `Product Clicked`      | User clicked on a product.                 |
| `Product List Viewed`  | User viewed the product collections page.  |
| `Product Viewed`       | User viewed a product page.                |

## FAQ

### I'm getting a Registration Failed/Updated Failed error when I enter the data plane URL and the write key. What should I do?
